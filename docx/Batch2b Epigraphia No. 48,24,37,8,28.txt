Vol. XXVIIINo. 48—PURI PLATES (SET B) OF GANGA NARASIMHA IV(1 Plates)D.C. Sircar, Ootacamund      Sometime ago, my friend Mr. Paramānanda Āchārya, Superintendent of Research and Museum, Government of Orissa, kindly sent me for examination a copper-plate inscription recently secured by him from Purī for the Orissa State Museum, Bhubaneswar. On examination, it was found to be the second of he two sets (A and B) of copper plates of the Eastern Gaṅga monarch Narasiṁha IV, published without facsimile by the late M.M. Chakravartī in J.A.S.B., Vol. LXIV, 1895, Part I, pp. 128 ff. It was also found that considerable improvement in Chakravartī’s reading and interpretation of the inscription, especially in the grant portion containing an early specimen of the Oṛiyā language, is possible. I am therefore re-editing the grant portion of the inscription incised on plate VI-VII.      Chakravartī found the inscription in the Śaṅkarānanda Maṭha at Purī, about half a mile to the south of the Jagannātha temple and close to the old palace of the Purī Rājās. It was originally incised on seven plates; out the fifth one, together with the seal, is missing. That only six loose plates (without the missing fifth plate) came into the possession of the Maṭha is indicated by a modern inscription in Dēvanāgarī on the obverse of the first plate. It runs as follows:      1 idaṁ tāmra-śāśana-saḍakaṁ      2 śrīmata-parmahaṁsa-parivrājakāchārja-Mōgavadhana-      3 piṭhādhīsa-jagadguru-daṁḍi-Bālabrahmīnaṁda-Sara-      4 svati-svāmīnā padē arapitam.1      The plate measure each 13.3 inches by 11.1 inches. The first and the seventh plates have inscription only on the inner side, while the other plates are inscribed on both the obverse and the reverse. The plates (with the exception of Plate VII which has no writing on the reverse) were consecutively numbered, the particular numerical figure being engraved on the left margin of the reverse of each plate. The figure for 1 is of the Telugu type, while those for 2 and 3 are of the medieval Bengali type, 2 resembling modern Telugu and English 3 and 3 the Dēvanāgarī form of the same numeral. The figure for 6 is interesting to note. The figures for 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 9 also occur in the text of the inscription (Plate VI B, lines 12, 21; Plate VII, line 3). The numbers of lines on the different plates are as follows: IB—25, IIA—24, IIB—24, IIIA—24, IIIB—25, IVA—24, IVB—25, VIA—24, VIB—28, VIIA—23. The six plates together weigh 851 tolas.      The characters of the inscription are Gauḍī influenced by Nāgarī, though a few letters (e.g. r) have forms approaching those of the letters in modern Oṛiyā. The engraving is carelessly done. A sibilant is often so formed that it is difficult to understand whether the engraver had the palatal or the dental in mind. In our transcript, we have sometimes ignored the forms of s looking like ś and vice versa. This is to avoid a large number of corrections in the transcript. The language of the versified portion of the inscription is Sanskrit; but the grant portion in prose is predominantly Oṛiyā. The orthography often exhibits influence of local pronunciation.2 The same proper name has sometimes been spelt differently (cf. Rāḍasōō=Rāḍhao=osaō, Raktapaṭā=Rakatao, Vāragō= Vārōgō, Ōḍamvōlō= Ōḍamōlō).      The charter was issued by the imperial Eastern Gaṅga monarch Narasiṁha IV who is known to have ruled in 1378-1402 A.C.3 It contains no less than three dates, the first in 1395 A.C., and the second and the third respectively in the following two years, viz., 1396 and 1397 A.C.      The first five plates (including the lost fifth plate) as well as three quarters of the obverse of the sixth plate are occupied by the introductory part of the charter dealing with the genealogy of the royal family to which the issuer belonged and the achievements of the imperial Gaṅga rulers down to the issuer himself. The importance of this part has often been discussed by scholars on the basis of Chakravartī’s transcript published more than half a century ago. In the present paper we are especially interested in the latter part of the document recording the grant made by Narasiṁha IV in favour of a Brāhmaṇa named Dēvarathāchārya who was apparently the priest in charge of the worship of a god named Ugrēśvaradēva.      The genealogical part of the inscription ends in line 19 on the obverse of plate VI. As one of the plates (Plate V) is lost, it is not possible to count the number of the lines in the inscription consecutively from the beginning. The end of the metrical part of the record dealing with Gaṅga genealogy is indicated by the words śubham=astu. The grant portion of the charter then begins with the date given in words as the expired Śaka year 1316. Line 20 says that the above year corresponded to the 22nd Aṅka year of king Vīra-śrī-Narasiṁhadēva (i.e., Narasiṁha IV of the imperial Gaṅga family) who was endowed with titles like “the lord of the fourteen worlds”. The details of the date on which the charter was drawn up are given in the next line as Tuesday, the eleventh tithi of the bright half of the month of Vṛiśchika, i.e., the solar Mārgaśīrsha or Agrahāyaṇa. The date is irregular for Śaka 1316 expired; but, for Śaka 1317 expired, it corresponds to Tuesday, the 23rd November, 1395 A.C.1 This date is said to have fallen in the 22nd Aṅka year, i.e., the 18th regnal year of the Gaṅga king Narasiṁha IV who is believed to have ascended the throne about 1378 A.C. and ruled at least up to year 1402 A.C. At the time of issuing the grant the śrī-charaṇa, i.e., the king, who purified (cf. a-rajāḥ) himself by offering worship (possibly to the family deity Purushōttama-Jagannātha2) was staying in the bhitara-navara of the kaṭaka (city or residence) of Vārāṇasī i.e., the present Cuttack. In this inscription, as in the corresponding passage of some records of the king’s ancestor Narasiṁha II (circa 1278-1305 A.C.), the word vijaya has been used in its modified Oṛiyā sense of ‘stay’, etc. Navara is an Oṛiyā corruption of Sanskrit nagara and means a city, palace, etc. Bhitara-navara, which is the same as abhyantara-nava(ga)ra of some grants of Narasiṁha II, seems to refer to the king’s stay in his palace at Cuttack. The following officers were then in the king’s present (lines 22-23): (1) Mahāpātra Kṛishṇānanda Sāndhivigrahika, (2) Mahāpātra Lāṇḍuratha Āchārya, (3) Mahāpātra Gōpīnātha Sāndhigrahika, (4) Pātra Siddhēśvara Jēnā, (5) Dvāraparīkshā Trivikrama Sāndhivigrahika, and (6) Kināi Sēnādhyaksha. Among the official designations, the word pātra indicates a minister and mahāpātra a minister of a higher rank. Sāndhivigrahika was a minister dealing with matters relating to war and peace. The word jēnā, originally meant a prince of the royal blood, but later came to be a title of the nobility and ultimately a family name. The word parīkshā (Oṛiyā parichhā) means a superintendent, governor, etc. Dvāraparīkshā seems therefore to be the same as the pratīhāra (officer in charge of the palace-gate). Sēnādhyaksha was a leader of the forces.      The last line (line 24) on the obverse of Plate VI says how the king (śrī-hasta; cf. śrī-charaṇa above) made a grant of land in favour of a Brāhmaṇa named Dēvarathāchārya in accordance with the mudala that had been settled before Purō-śrīkaraṇa Viśvanātha Mahāsēnāpati. Mudala is a Telugu word meaning ājñā or order and is first noticed in the records of Narasiṁha II. In Oṛiyā, however, the word seems to be used in a modified sense to indicate an arrangement made according to order. That mudala and ājñī were not used in Oṛiyā exactly in the same sense is suggested by epigraphic passages using both of them. The Oṛiyā inscriptions of the Sūryavaṁśīs have the following passages in a similar context: āigāṁ hōilā, Agnisarmā mudrāhastara gōcharē vōilā mudalē, avadhārita ā ṁgā pramānē, avadhārīta āgyāṁ vōilā mudalē, samastaṅka mukāvilārē āigāṁ hōilā, pujā-avakāśē gyāṁ hōilā, āgyāṁ vōli hōilā, etc.1 We have to note also the expressions Gatēśvara-dāsa-śrīchandana-āgi  avadhārita ājñā- vōilā mudalē and avadhārita-mudala-pramāṇē occurring in the latter part of our inscription. The same modified sense of the word can also be traced in the Mādalā Pāñjī 2 in such passages as śrī-navarē vijē kari mudala karāilē, śrī-pāda-mudalē, rājyaru ē-manta mudala karāi, etc. Mahāsenāpati was a high military officer, apparently higher than the sēnādhyaksha mentioned earlier. Śrīkaraṇa indicates a scribe-accountant and purō, prefixed to it, may possibly connect the official with the pura or capital of the Gaṅga monarch, although it may also be connected with Sanskrit puras and point to a front rank among the Śrīkaraṇas. The word purō occurs in another grant of Narasiṁha IV as pōrō, while the Mādalā Pāñjī speaks of two officers of a Gaṅga king named Anaṅgabhīma as Pōra-Pāñjīdhara-Parīkshā Mithuni Paṇḍā and Pōra-Śrīkaraṇa Suruya-Puranāyaka.3      Line 1 on the reverse of Plate VI says that the land granted to Dēvarathāchārya measured one hundred vāṭīs. It is further said (lines 1-5) that on Paṇḍitavāra (Wednesday), the 2nd of the solar month of Vṛiśchika (Mārgaśīrsha) and seventh tithi of the dark half of the lunar month in the 23rd Aṅka year, the śrī-charaṇa (king), when he was doing japa (counting of beads) after having offered worship at the kaṭaka (city or residence) of Dēvakūṭa and when number of officials were in his presence, granted two villages covering one hundred vāṭīs of land to Dēvarathāchārya. The details of the date show that it corresponds to Wednesday, the 22nd November, A.C. 1396, a year after the grant was originally made. The officers present on this occasion were: (1) Pātra Māhāmuni Purōhita, (2) Dvāraparīkshā Trivikrama Sandhivigraha (Sāndhivigrahika), the same as No. 5 of the first list of officials quoted above, (3) Vuḍhālēṅkā Sōmanātha Vāhinīpati, and (4) Bhitara-bhaṇḍāra-adhikārī Narahari Sandhivigraha. In the official designation Vuḍhālēṅkā, the word vuḍhā is the same as Sanskrit vṛiddha (Prakrit vuḍḍhā)=mahā, while lēṅkā means a Śūdra servant of a king or a deity. Vāhinīpati was a commander of the forces, possibly the same as Sēnāḍhyaksha mentioned in the first list quoted above. The designation Bhitara-bhaṇḍāra-adhikārī (bhitara being the same as Sanskrit abhyantara) suggest that there was another officer styled Bahir-bhāṇḍār-ādhikārin. The Bhitara-bhaṇḍāra-adhikārī was probably the officer in charge of the treasury or store-house in the inner part of the royal palace. On this occasion also the mudala or arrangement regarding the grant was made in the presence of the officer Purō-śrīkaraṇa Viśvanātha Mahāsēnāpati. According to this arrangement (lines 4-5 on the reverse of Plate VI), the one hundred vāṭīs of land granted to Dēvarathāchārya were offered in the form of two villages situated in the Madanakhaṇḍa vishaya which formed a part of Kōshṭhadēśa consisting of eight khaṇḍas or divisions (like the said Madana-khaṇḍa). Madanakhaṇḍa is later referred to as Oḍamvōlō (or Oḍamōlō)-Madanakhaṇḍa. The two gift villages are called here Sāisōgrāmī-Mōkshēśvara and Dakshiṇa-Rāḍasōōgrāma, although later the former has been referred to only as Sāisōgrāma and the later sometimes as Rāḍhao or osaō. The first village was a part of Sāisōgrāma, known as Mōkshēśvara. Kōshṭhadēśa or Kōṭhadēśa is the name of a Pargana in the Puri District; but the expression may also indicate an area in the king’s private possession.      Line 5-11 say how on Saturday, the Mīna-saṅkrānti on the eleventh tithi of the dark fortnight in the same year (ē-srāhi), the villages Sāisō and Dakshiṇa-Rāḍasaō (i.e. South Rāḍasaō) granted to Dēvarathāchārya were made the dēulī-bhūmi or temple land of the god Ugrēśvaradēva of Kōshṭhadēśa. The date corresponds to Saturday, the 24th February 1397 A.C., i.e. about three months later. The king (śrī-charaṇa) was then staying at the kaṭaka of Nārāyaṇapura and, while coming back from that place after having offered worship, had beside him the officers: (1) Vuḍhālēṅkā Sōmanātha Vāhinīpati, the same as No. 3 of the second list, (2) Bhuvanēśvara Sandhivigraha, (3) Lakshmaṇānanda Sandhivigraha, and (4) Bhitara-bhaṇḍāra-adhikārī Narahari Sandhivigraha, the same as No. 4 of the second list, which has been quoted and discussed above. The mudala is said to have been settled in the presence of Dvāraparīkshā Trivikrama Sandhivigraha, known from both the first and the second lists quoted above, and also of Āmi-Purō-parīksha-Mahāpātra Gatēśvaradāsa Śrīchandana. The word Āmi in the official designation of Gatēśvaradāsa who had the title Śrīchandana (that came to be a title of nobility), seems to be the same as Arabic Amīn probably indicating an officer of the revenue or judicial department. This suggestion cannot be regarded as improbable in view of the use of words like mukāvilā (Arabic muqābl, Persian muqābilā) in the records of the Śūryavaṁśīs, quoted above. The expression ājñā-vōilā-mudalē (literally, “according to the arrangement was made in accordance with the words of the order”) may suggest that the said arrangement was made by Gatēśvaradāsa on behalf of Trivikrama. The gift land (śāsana), having the boundaries fixed on all the four sides and including the temple (of Ugrēśvaradēva), was endowed with a paṭā or deed (lines 10-11). Thus, although originally Dēvarathāchārya, who seems to have been the priest of the god Ugrēśvaradēva, was intended to be the donee of one hundred vāṭīs of land, the god himself was ultimately made the donee of the above land as well as of the land around the temple.      Lines 11-20 describe the first of the three plots of the gift land. It was the village of Sāisō situated in Oḍamvōlō-Madanakhaṇḍa. Its income to go to the king’s revenue department (kōṭhavyāpārara bhāga) is given in words as 322 māḍhas but in figures as 322/6 in which 6 indicates a fraction (gaṇḍā?) of the māḍha. Māḍha now indicates the weight of half a tola and the coin of this name referred to in the record was either of gold or silver of the said weight. It appears, however, that, in lieu of land, actually the revenue of the village called Sāisōgrāma, amounting to a little above 322 māḍhas possibly of silver was granted. The contraction kai, put after the amount of money in this case, is also noticed in the latter part of the inscription in lines 21 (saē-satāisa-māḍha 127 kai) and 26 (triśa-vāṭi 30 kai). It may have the meaning of the usual expression aṅkēn=āpi which, however, is placed before the figures. Possibly it is contraction of Sanskrit kēvala meaning ‘only’.1 The grant seems to have been made with vṛiddhi and avadāna. In Oṛiyā the word avadāna is used in the sense of a gift.2 Thus the passages vṛiddhi-avadāna madhya kari may indicate “together with the power to improve and alienate the land.” But it is better to suggest that the amount of income quoted included vṛiddhi and avadāna. In that case they would mean ‘supertax’ and ‘tax’ repectively.3 The record next enumerates the boundaries of the above village according to the determination of Thamaṭhi-nāēka (nāyaka) who was the paḍihasta (i.e. pratihasta or representative) of Purō-śrīkaraṇa Viśvanātha Mahāsēnāpati. The eastern boundary started from parts of the road to Chandraprabhā lying to the west of the śāsana (gift village) of Bhagavatīpura and ran up to the Hijala tree near or on the tank of or at Pōḍāpōḍā to the easts of Vāṅgarisōgrāma. The northern boundary began with parts of the road to the north of the house of Chiḍichiḍi lying to the south of Vāṅgarisōgrāma and of the three-pronged cattle track going to the house of the Brāhmaṇas and ended in half of the waters (adhā-sōi for Sanskrit ardha-srōtas) of the river Vāiṅgaṇī (later also called Vāiṅgaṇiā). The western boundary began with half of the waters of the Vāiṅgaṇī river to the east of Rāḍasaōgrāma and ended with parts of the cattle track going to Kuchiāgāi to the south of Āmvatōṭā on the river bank of Gōpīnāthapura on the further side (of the river Vāiṅgaṇī). The southern boundary began with Harāgaū to the north of Gōpīnāthapura and ran up to the northern bank of the river (Vāiṅgaṇī) and to parts of the three-pronged cattle track going to the śāsanas (gift villages) of Bhagavatīpura and Gōpīnāthapura. In all (gā), this was one village with fixed boundaries on all the four sides.      Lines 20-26 describe the second plot of land consisting of the village of Rāḍasaō (i.e. Dakshiṇa-Rāḍasōō) situated in the same vishaya. The grant was made with vṛiddhi, saïkā and avadāna. The terms vṛiddhi and avadāna have been discussed above; the meaning of saïkā is uncertain. It may stand for Sanskrit śatikā and indicate a tax collected on the basis of a hundred articles of a kind. The income of the village is given both in words and figures as 127 māḍhas, probably of silver. This income is qualified by a passage which seems to suggest that it was being enjoyed by the king’s second queen (majhi-ghara) for worshipping the god Purushōttama. The eastern boundary of the said gift village started with parts of the waters of the Vāiṅgaṇiā river to the west of Sāisōgrāma and ran up to parts of the road going to Rakatapaṭā (or Raktapaṭā) to the south of the temple land (of Ugrēśvaradēva). The northern boundary began with parts of the road to Raktapaṭā to the south of the temple land and ended in parts of the waters of the Vārōgō (or Vāragō) river. The western boundary started from parts of the waters of the Vāragō river to the east of the Vijayalakshmīpura śāsana (gift village) and ended in parts of the cattle track below the embankment called Sudunāghāi in the Gōpīnāthapura śāsana. The southern boundary seems to have begun with parts of the cattle track on the river bank to the north of the Gōpīnāthapura śāsana and to the west of Āmvatōṭā and ended in parts of the waters of the Vāiṅgaṇiā river. In all (gā), it was one village with settled boundaries on all the four sides. As in the case of Sāisōgrāma, only the income of the village seems to have been granted to the donee.      The third piece of the gift land, situated in the same vishaya, is described in lines 26 ff. It consisted of 30 vāṭīs of land apparently around the temple of Ugrēśvara. The eastern boundary of this land, called a grāma without mentioning its name, ran from the Vāiṅgaṇiā river to the west of Vāṅgarisōgrāma to parts of the cattle track on the river bank to the east of Vāliāgrāma. The northern boundary ran from the Vōhāla road (possibly indicating a road marked by a Vōhāla tree) at the head of a field to the south of Vāliāgrāma to parts of (the waters of) the Vāragō river. The western boundary seems to have started from parts of the waters of the Vāragō river to the east of the Vijayalakshmīpura śāsana and ended in a point which is left out owing to inadvertence. The southern boundaru ran up to parts of the road going to Rakatapaṭā to the north of Rāḍhasōōgrāma. Line 2 on Plate VII says that the above land was in all (gā) one grāma having fixed boundaries on all the four sides. The next line says that the gift altogether consisted of three grāmas of which the jita1 or income was 449/5 māḍhas and the land measured 30 vāṭīs. It may be pointed out that 322/6 māḍhas and 127 māḍhas would make actually 449/6 māḍhas.      The above gift land was granted, according to lines 3-5, to Dēvarathāchārya to last as long as the moon and the sun would endure by means of the deed of gift, together with (mudhya kari water, land, fish, tortoise, tree and forest and with the temple of Ugrēśvaradēva and the land around it. Lines 5-8 say partly in repetition of what was said above that Narasiṁhadēvavarman of the Ātrēya gōtra granted the two villages of Sāisō and Dakshiṇa-Rāḍasōō, situated in the Oḍamōlō-Madanakhaṇḍa vishaya and having the boundaries specified above, to the Brāhmaṇa Dēvarathaśarman of the Ātrēya gōtra, a student of the Kāṇva branch of the Yajurvēda, as a permanent rent-free holding, together with water, land, fish, tortoise, tree, forest, sand and bhiṭā (homestead land). It is interesting to note that the Gaṅga king adopts the Kshatriya name-ending varman as his ancestor Bhānu II does in his Puri plates.1 The Tārīkh-ī-Firūzshāhī,2 while describing Sulṭān Fīrūz Shāh’s invasion of Jājnagar (i.e., the Gaṅga kingdom of Orissa) during the reign of Bhānu III, speaks of the Rāīs of that country (i.e., the Gaṅga kings) as Brāhmaṇas. It thus appears that the Gaṅga monarchs claimed variously to be Brāhmaṇas or Kshatriyas of the Ātrēya gōtra, although basically they must have been Dravidians. As I have shown elsewhere the claim to the Ātrēya gōtra was essentially connected with the genealogy of the Gaṅga family, fabricated by the court-poets of Anantavarman Chōḍagaṅga.3 According to lines 8-9, the Tāmrādhikārin (the same as the Śāsanādhikārin or keeper and writer of records), Narahari Sandhivigraha, appears to have received as his perquisite one vāṭī of land out of the gift land, according to an arrangement approved of by the respectable people of the villages. The next line says how the Tāmralēkhaka (engraver of the plates), Gurudāsa Sēnāpati, received half of the area of land received by the Tāmrādhikārin. Gurudāsa, however, appears to have been too big an officer to engrave plates and it is possible to think that he got the work done by a coppersmith.4 The charter proper is followed in lines 10-18 by nine of the usual imprecatory and benedictory verses. The above verses are followed by three new stanzas in lines 18-23. The text of the verses is extremely corrupt.      A number of geographical names are mentioned in the inscription. The different orders of the king in regard to the grant recorded here were issued when he was staying at Vārāṇasī (modern Cuttack), Dēvakūṭa and Nārāyaṇapura. Of the three plots of gift-land, the first consisted of Sāisōgrāma (also once called Sāisōgrāmī-Mōkshēśvara) and the second of the South Rāḍasōōgrāma (also called Rāḍhao and osaōgrāma), both situated in the vishaya called Kōshṭhadēśa-Madanakhaṇḍa or Ōḍamvōla (Oḍamōlō)-Madanakhaṇḍa, while the third plot consisted of 30 vāṭīs of land belonging to the temple of the god called Kōshṭhadēśa-Ugrēśvaradēva. In describing the boundaries of Sāisōgrāma, mention has been made of Bhagavatīpura-śāsana, Chandraprabhā, Vāṅgarisōgrāma, Vāingaṇī-nadī, Rāḍasōō, Gōpīnāthapura-śāsana, Āmvatōṭā, Kuchiāgāi and Harāgaū. In the description of the boundaries of Dakshiṇa-Rāḍasōōgrāma, mention is made of Sāisōgrāma, Vāiṅgaṇiā-nadī, Raktapaṭā, Vāragō (or Vārōgō)-nadī, Vijayalakshmīpura-śāsana, Gōpīnāthapura-śāsana, Sudunāghāi and Āmvatōṭā. In connection with the boundaries of the third plot of land, are similarly mentioned Vāṅgarisōgrāma, Vāiṅgaṇiyā-nadī, Vāliāgrāma, Vāragō-nadī, Vijayalakshmīpura, Rāḍasōō and Raktapaṭā. The three plots of land were adjacent to one another. M.M. Chakravartī located the villages approximately at 850 56' 45" long. by 200 10' 17" lat. on the left side of the Bhārgavī river and close to the P.W.D. Bungalow at Khirkhia. The Survey of India sheet map No. 73 H 3 B shows, between the rivers Bhārgavī and Dhanuā, the locality called Ugreswar Deuli having the Bhārgavī in the west, Banguras (Vāṅgarisō) Śāsan in the north, Gōpīnāthpur towards the south and Bhāgavatīpur towards east-south-east.  As a result of the grant under discussion, the old names, viz., Sāisō and Rāḍasōō, appear to have given place to the new name, viz., Ugrēśvara-dēulī, suggested by it.TEXT1Sixth Plate: First Side

Vol. XXXIINo. 24—PATTALI GRANT OF YUVARAJA REJENDRAVARMAN, GANGA YEAR 313(1 Plate)D.C. Sircar, Ootacamund      This inscription was published by Mr. Manda Narasimham in the Telugu journal Bhārati, June 1954, pp. 574 ff. In April 1956, it was purchased from Mr. Narasimham for the Epigraphical Gallery in the Office of the Government the Epigraphist for India. Nothing is known to us about the findspot of the record and the story of its discovery. Mr. Narasimham’s article in the Bhārati does not disclose any fact in these respects. But there is little doubt that the plates were discovered somewhere in the Srikakulam District of Andhra Pradesh.      The inscription is written on three copper plates held together by a ring bearing the seal of the issuer of the charter. The plates are rectangular is shape and measure each 7½ inches in length and 3½ inches in height. They have slightly raised rims. There is a hole (about 2/5 inch in diameter) in the left side of the plates for the ring to pass through. The diameter of the ring is about 4½ inches while its thickness is about 2/5 inch. The ends of the ring are soldered to the bottom of a thick circular seal about 1 inch in diameter. On the countersunk surface of the seal, which is considerably corroded, there are traces of the figure of a standing animal which is no doubt a bull that was the emblem of the Eastern Gaṅga kings. The three plates together weigh about 94 tolas and the ring and the seal about 38 tolas.      There are altogether 37 lines of writing in the inscription. But line 30 containing only three aksharas written between the beginning of lines 29 and 31 is not a continuous line, while the last line contains only one aksharas followed by a daṇḍa. The inscription is incised on the inner side of the first plate and both the sides of the second and third plates. It has, however, to be noticed that, through oversight, the engraver originally began to incise the concluding part of the record (lines 34 ff.) on the outer side of the first plate instead of on the corresponding side of the third plate, which is its proper place. But the mistake was detected when only one line and a half had been engraved on the reverse of the first plate.      The characters belong to the later Kaliṅga script and resemble those of many early medieval inscriptions discovered in the Srikakulam region. The letter dh has the form of ddh in some cases as noticed often in inscriptions in the later Kaliṅga alphabet. The language of the record is corrupt Sanskrit and it is written in prose with the exception of a few imprecatory and benedictory stanzas at the end. In point of orthography, the record resembles other epigraphs of the area and age in question. The grant was issued in the year 313 of the Gaṅga era, which fell in the period between 809 and 811 A.D. The date is written both in words and in figures; but there are no other details of the date.      The charter was issued from Kaliṅganagara by Yuvarāja Rājendravarman, described as the son of Mahārājādhirāja Paramēśvara Parambhaṭṭāraka Anantavarman of the Eatern Gaṅga family. It records the grant firstly of the village of Pāṭṭali (elsewhere called Pāḍali) situated in the territorial unit called Kṛishṇamaṭṭamba, in favour of the goddess Kañchipōṭṭi-bhaṭṭārikā in order to provide for her offerings, etc., by Yuvarāja Rājēndravarman himself and secondly of Kuśasaṅkira-grāma in Dāpupañchālī and Arali-grāma in Jāmbōṭṭa-pañchālī in favour of the same deity by Rājēndravarman’s mother Lōka-mahādēvī. The primary object of the charter was to record the grant of Pāṭṭali-grāma since the order of the Yuvarāja was issued to the inhabitants of that village only. That Lōka-mahādēvī’s grant of the villages of Kuśasaṅkira and Arali was added to the main charter as a subsidiary issue is further suggested by the fact that the boundaries of the gift land quoted in lines 24 ff. refer to the village of Pāḍali (i.e Pāṭṭali) only.      The village of Pāṭṭali or Pāḍali was bounded in the east by a naidhāni-śilā (probably meaning ‘a boundary pillar’) and a bilva tree; in the south by a pit and another naidhāni-śilā; in the west by a pit (called Bhuṭṭaka probably after the name of the locality or its owner) and a mango tree; and in the north by a pit (called Kāśimbi probably after the name of the locality or its owner) and certain forests. The above section of the charter is followed in lines 26 ff. by some of the well-known imprecatory and benedictory verses. The date of the grant, viz. year 313, is quoted in lines 34-35 as the year of the victorious reign of the Gaṅgēya dynasty. The document was written by Mahāsāndhivigrahika (i.e. the officer in charge of war and peace) Sāmirāja and the plates were angraved by the akshaśālin (i.e. goldsmith) Dāmachandra.      The importance of the inscription lies in the fact that it is one of the few charters issued by a crown-prince, the most well-known instance of this class of documents being the Mayidavolu plates1 of the Pallava Yuvamahārāja Śivaskandavarman who flourished in the first half of the fourth century A.D. The circumstances leading to the issue of a charter by the crown-prince instead of the king himself in these cases cannot be determined.      In order to determine the identity of the Gaṅga crown-prince Rājēndravarman, son of king Anantavarman, we have to take note of the following records of the family: (1) Alamanda plates2 of Anantavarman son of Mahārāja Rājēndravarman, dated year 304; (2) Indian Museum plates3 of Mahārāja Dēvēndravarman, son of Mahārāja Rājēndravarman, dated year 308, (3) Tekkali plates4 of the same king, dated year 310; (4) Nāmpali grant5 of Yuvarāja Rājēndravarman, son of king Anantavarman, dated year 314; and (5) Mandasa plates6 of Rājēndravarman, son of Anantavarman, dated year 342. These records show that the Gaṅga king Rājēndravarman was succeeded by his sons Anantavarman (year 304) and Dēvēndravarman (years 308 and 310) and that Dēvēndravarman was succeeded by Rājēndravarman, son of his elder brother and predecessor Anantavarman. The charter under study, issued by Anantavarman’s son Rājēndravarman of Yuvarāja in the year 313, is therefore the third of his known records, the other two being his Nāmpali grant issued likewise as Yuvarāja in the year 314 and his imperfectly deciphered Mandasa plates of the year 342 probably issued as king. The present epigraph mentions Lōka-mahādēvī, mother of Rājēndravarman and queen of Anantavarman, for the first time. The Nāmpali charter records the grant of Nāmpali-grāma situated in Nidijēru-vishaya in favour Sāmirāja, son of Gulāmarāja (wrongly read as Guṇamarāja) of the Ayana-kula. It was written by Mahāsāndhivigrahin Raha (i.e. Rahasya or Rahasyādhikṛita) Śrī-Sāmanta1 and engraved by Akshaśālin Dāmachandra. It will be seen that the same Akshaśālin Dāmachandra was also the engraver of the charter under study while Sāmirāja, donee of the Nāmpali grant, seems to be none other than Mahāsāndhivigrahika Sāmirāja who was its writer. It is interesting to note that the Mandasa plates, issued by Rājēndravarman more than quarter of a century later, was written by Sandhivigrahin Raṇōmēya who was the son of the said Sāmirāja.2      An interesting feature of the records of Rājēndravarman, issued by him as Yuvarāja during the years 313 and 314, is that they do not refer to the rule of his uncle Dēvēndravarman who is known to have issued charters in the years 308 and 310. It should also be noticed that Yuvarāja Rājēndravarman’s grants dated in the years 313 and 314 and Dēvēndravarman’s charters dated in the years 308 and 310 were all issued from the city of Kaliṅganagara. In the present state of insufficient information on the point, it is difficult to suggest any hostility between Rājēndravarman and his uncle only on this ground. We know that the Early Eastern Gaṅga kings generally represented themselves each as the son of his father and not as the successor of his predecessor. As for instance, Dēvēndravarman’s charters described him as the son of Rājēndravarman and not as the successor of his elder brother and predecessor Anantavarman. But Yuvarāja Rājēndravarman’s case is somewhat different since he issued the charters in question as a crown-prince when his uncle Dēvēndravarman may have been on the throne. As, however, the Mayidavolu plates were similarly issued by the Pallava Yuvamahārāja Śivaskandavarman without any reference to the reigning Pallava king who was probably his father, it is not easy to arrive at a conclusion from this fact.      Besides Kaliṅganagara, the capital of the Eastern Gaṅgas, identified generally with modern Mukhalingam near Srikakulam, and the well-known Mahēndragiri peak on the borders between the Ganjam and Srikakulam Districts, the inscription mentions the following geographical names; the villages of Pāṭṭali or Pāḍali, Kuśasaṅkira and Arali as well as the districts of Kṛishṇamaṭṭamba, Dāpu-pañchālī and Jāmbōṭṭa-pañchālī. I am not sure about their location.

Gai,Ootacamund      At the end of August 1957, the office of the Government Epigraphist for India, Ootacamund, acquired these plates from Shri Manda Narasimham of Śrīkākuḷam. Dr. B.Ch. Chhabra, Government Epigraphist for India, kindly entrusted the plates to me for studying and editing in the pages of this journal. The plates were discovered by a farmer while digging in a field in front of his house at Arasavalli in the Srikakulam Taluk, Visakhapatnam District. They were purchased by Shri Bhanumurti Pantulu, a teacher at Śrīkākuḷam. Shri Manda Narasimham, who obtained them from the latter, has published them in the Telugu journal Bhārati, May 1954, pp. 449 ff.1      This is a set of five copper-plates, each measuring about 8.5 inches by 3 inches. On the left side of each plate is a hole, about one inch in diameter, through which passes a circular ring about 3.75 inches in diameter. To this ring is attached a seal which is circular in shape and which measures about 2 inches in diameter. In the centre of the seal is the seated figure of a bull together with the other usual emblems found in the seals of the grants of Vajrahasta III. The first plate is inscribed on one side while the remaining four plates bear writing on both sides. The states of preservation of the writing is not satisfactory, specially on the fourth and fifth plates which cover the grant portion. The plates weigh 160 tolas while the ring the seal weighs 58 tolas.      The characters belong to the variety called eastern Nāgarī and resemble those found in the other charters of Vajrahasta (III).2 In respect of orthography, it may be observed that ñ is written with the upper part of the symbol separated, cf. lines 6, 11 and 15. N is represented by two forms; cf. lines 1, 4 and 7 for one type and lines 69, 70 and 71 for the other. It is difficult to distinguish between p and y. The symbol for v denotes b as well. In most cases, the consonant following r is reduplicated.      The language of the record is Sanskrit and the text is written in prose and verse.      The inscription belongs to the reign of the Eastern Gaṅga king Vajrahasta (III, 1038-70 A.D.), the son of Kāmārṇava and Vinayamahādēvī. It contains the praśasti beginning with śrīmatām=akhila-bhuvana, etc., introduced by this king. The text of the inscription upto line 39, comprising the introductory portion, is identical with that found in the other records of the king.3 It may be pointed out that while the Nadagam, Narasapatam, Peddabammidi, Chicacole and the present plates introduce the ruling king as śrīmad-Vajrahastadēvaḥ, the Madras Museum, Ganjam, Chikkalavalasa and the Boddapāḍu plates refer to him as śrīmad-Anantavarmmā Vajrahastadēvaḥ. The present inscription does not supply any new historical information.      The grant was issued from Kaliṅganagara, usually identified with Mukhaliṅgam. The record registers the grant of the village Harisavēlli (line 40) situated in Varāhavarttanī (vishaya). The gift village is mentioned again as Arisavalli in line 67, along with its adjoining village Māvēṇḍi. Varāha-varttanī occurs in the other records of this king as well as of other members of this dynasty and is usually taken to correspond to the area near modern Śrīkākuḷam.      The date of our grant, which occurs in lines 42-43, is expressed in the chronogram, karavasu-nidhi-Śāk-ābdē, i.e. Śaka 982, Kārttika, the twelfth day of the first fortnight, Monday. It regularly corresponds to Monday, October 9, A.D. 1060. It is earlier than the date of the Paddabammidi plates by two months and nineteen days only. Kārttika śu. 12 is known in the Kannaḍa-Telugu speaking area as Utthāna-dvādaśī, i.e., the day on which god Vishṇu is woken up from his long sleep. It is also called Prabōdhōtsava. This tithi is also known for the end of Chāturmāsyavrata (which begins on the same tithi in the month of Āshāḍha) and Tulasī-vivāha (the marriage of Vishṇu with the Tulasī plant). The previous day, i.e. ēkādaśī, is called Prabōdhinī ēkādaśī.      The details of the grant are given in lines 43 ff. This portion is defective in many places and so it is difficult to make out the purport satisfactory. As stated above, the inscription registers the gift of the village Harisavēlli which is also called Arisavalli. It appears that the village was originally given by the king to the son and three daughters of Dālamapenggaḍa and his wife Mavanaka. Dālamapenggaḍa is stated to have been the chief minister (mahāpradhāna). The names of his son and daughters are given respectively as Mēḍapa-nāyaka, Viddāma, Mēḍama and Pōtama. The subsequent assignment1 of the gift village was as follows: The village was divided into four parts and one part was given to Śiriyapa-nāyaka, Vajjināyaka, Guṇḍamanāyaka and Nuṁkamanāyaka who were the sons of Naḍupana-nāyaka, a Kāyastha of Kāśyapa-gōtra, and his wife Paitapā. This part constituted the units called Puṇḍi-niyōga and Pāmchāli-niyōga.2 This portion was further divided into nineteen shares out of which eighteen shares were taken by Vajji-nāyaka, Guṇḍama-nāyaka and Nuṁkama-nāyaka (mentioned above) while the remaining share was given to Naḍupanāyaka, son of Śiriyapanāyaka.3 Again the second part of the village was divided into five shares as follows: one share to Guṇḍana and Apētana,4 sons of Māviraṭṭaḍi of Śūdra-vaṁśa and his wife Viṭṭapā; one share to Chandēna, son of the younger Dāmaraṭṭaḍi and his wife Sāyapā; one share to Chāmēna son of Viṭṭanaraṭṭaḍi and his wife Sarvapā; one share to Māṁkana and Duggana, son of Mādiraṭṭaḍi and his wife Chinnapā; and one share to Kaṭṭana and Viṭṭana, sons of Dugganaraṭṭaḍi and his wife Gavakā. The part, consisting of these five shares, constituted the units known as Gavaḍa-niyōga and Chandrāditya-niyōga.      The record then proceeds to state that the village was divided into Santāraha-bhāga, the meaning of which is doubtful. We know that the village was originally divided into four parts. Out of these, two parts have been disposed of as indicated above and the fourth part is accounted for later in the record. Therefore, this corresponded to the third part of the village, which was probably divided into seventeen shares and given to Dāmara-nāyaka and Viṇarāyi-nāyaka, sons of Kāyastha Chaṇḍu-nāyaka of Kāśyapa-gōtra. It appears that the grant was made at the instance of Iddachāhapa and that the recipients in their turn granted some portion to Nūṁkamōja, son of Chīḍumōja. The record next states that the king Vajrahasta granted the village Māvēṇḍi, apparently adjoining the village Arisavalli in whose revenues it was included.1 The inscription then proceeds to account for the fourth part out of the four parts into which the gift village Harisavēlli was divided. This fourth and last part was divided into eight shares and distributed as follows: two shares to Kāyastha Nūṁkapa: one share each to Kāyastha Sōmanātha and Kāyastha Dāmara: and one share to Chīḍana of Chaturtha-vaṁśa i.e. Śūdra community.2 These shares constituted the units Raṭṭaḍa-niyōga and Vuṁcha-niyōga. It is not known whether the remaining three shares (out of the eight) were also included in these two niyōgas.      In the concluding part the record states that Chirīyapa-nāyaka and Chiḍapōta-nāyaka granted half of the share of Bhadima-nāyaka3 owned by the latter in the units Puṇḍi-niyōga and Pāṁchāli-niyōga. The grant was made to Pinnamanāyaka and Māvuranāyaka, sons of Apitamanāyaka [(added to from additions) The reading of the name read as Apitama-nāyaka may also be Ayitama-nāyaka.] It is possible that the donors Chirīyapanāyaka and Chiḍapōta-nāyaka were the sons of Bhadima-nāyaka. But how the latter got shares in Puṇḍi-niyōga and Pāṁchāli-niyōga is not made clear.      The gift-village Harisavēlli, also called Arisavalli, is to be identified with modern Arasavalli in the Srikakulam Taluk, where the plates were discovered. The adjoining village mentioned in the record as Māvēṇḍi is not shown on the maps.      The inscription does not give the usual imprecatory verses at the end. As the recipients of the grant were Kāyasthas and Śūdras and as the record does not state that the gift was free from taxes, it appears to be a kara-śāsana.TEXT4[Metres: Verses 1, 4, 12

Vol. XXXIVNo. 8—BODDAPADU PLATES OF VAJRAHASTA (III), SAKA 982G.S. Gai, Ootacamund(Received on 20.9.1958)      While examining a bundle of old impressions in the Office of the Government Epigraphist for India, I came across a set of impressions  of a copper-plate grant which was registered as C.P. No. 1 of 1925-26 in the Annual Report on South India Epigraphy for that year. It is stated in this Report that the record belongs to an unknown king of the Eastern Chālukya dynasty and is dated in Śaka 982. On an examination of the impression, I found that the information given in the Report was not correct and that the inscription really belongs to the Eastern Gaṅga king Vajrahasta III. In fact, it is the same as the Boḍḍapāḍu plates of Vajrahasta III published by Shri M. Somasekhara Sarma in the Telugu journal Bhārati, Vol. III, No. 5 (May 1926) pp. 83 ff. The inscription is edited here from the set of impressions with the kind permission of the authority mentioned above.      According to Shri Sarma’s account, the plates were discovered about 50 years ago by one Appalanāyuḍu, a resident of the village of Boḍḍapāḍu in the Srikakulam Taluk, while reclaiming his lands for cultivation towards the east of the village. A liṅga was also found at a distance of a few yards from the findspot of the plates. This liṅga which is called Mallikēśvara by the residents of Boḍḍapāḍu may possibly represent the god Jalēśvara mentioned in the inscription.      The set consists of five plates, each measuring about 8·4" by 3·3". On the left side of each plate is a hole, about ·5" in diameter, through which passes a circular ring about 3·5" in diameter. To this ring is attached a seal which is stated to contain the representation of the crescent moon, bull, goad (aṅkuśa), conch-shell (śaṅkha), fish, etc. The weight of the set is not recorded. The first and fifth plates are inscribed only on the inner side while the remaining three plates contain writing on both the sides. The writing is in a fairly good state of preservation.      The characters are eastern Nāgarī. They resemble those of the other charters of Vajrahasta.1 Of initial vowel, a, ā, i, ī, u and ē occur in the inscription. Ñ in ñch and ñchh is separated and placed to the right of the subscript. The symbol for v denotes b also. The language of the inscription is Sanskrit and the text is written in prose as well as verse. As regards orthography, it may be observed that the consonant following r is usually redoubled. In the introductory portion of the record in lines 1-39, the same orthographical errors are found in this as well as in other records of the king; e.g. śalila for salila, prakshyālita for prakshālita, oōtuṅga for oōttuṅga, etc. In a few cases, the rules of sandhi have not been observed.      The record belongs to the reign of the Eastern Gaṅga king Vajrahasta III who ruled in 1038-70 A.D. As indicated above, the introductory portion comprising text lines 1-39 is identical with that found in the other records of this king. It may be observed that the king is introduced as śrīmad-Anantavarmmā Vajrahastadēvaḥ and not merely as śrīmad-Vajrahastadēvaḥ.2      The date of the inscription is given in line 42 as Śaka 982, expressed by the chronogram karavasu-nidhi, Uttarāyaṇa-saṅkrānti. Besides the present grant, three other records of this king, viz. Peddabammiḍi, Chikkalavalasa and Arasavalli plates1 are dated in the same Śaka year. The English equivalent of this year would be 1060 A.D. Uttarāyaṇa-saṅkrānti occurred in that year on Sunday, the 24th December, 1060 A.D. which seems to be the date of our record.      Like the other charters of the king, the present grant was issued from Kaliṅganagara which has been identified with Mukhaliṅgam. The record states (lines 39-40 and 43) that the village of Avarēṁga in the Kōluvartani district (vishaya) was given as a bhōga to the god Jalēśvara of the same village. Lines 43-45 state that mādara-manavarttika was given to Ērayama, the son of Māvaya and his wife Kaṁchapā and the grandson of Ērayama of the Vaiśya family. It appears that Ērayama paid some money and received the village of Avarēṁga from the king as mādara-manavarttika for the creation of a bhōga to the god Jalēśvara. In other words Ērayama seems to be responsible for the gift of the village. The meaning of the expression mādara-manavarttika is not clear. Manavarttika, also spelt as manavarttikā (line 52), is not found in Sanskrit lexicons and may be the same as manuvṛitti, manuvartti or manōvartti given in Brown’s Telugu-English Dictionary in the sense of maintenance, support or allowance’. Shri Sarma suggests that the term mādara may refer to the Mēdara community whose profession is making baskets, mats, etc., of bamboo splits. But this meaning does not suit here since the said community is regarded as very low in the social order whereas Ērayama is stated to have belonged to the Vaiśya or merchant community. It is possible that the term mādara is a mistake for s-ādara and the whole expression means that the king gave the village to Ērayama as a manavarttika with due regards. Lines 52-53 inform us that a manavarttikā in the same village was given, apparently by Ērayama, to the mahākshaśālin Vallēmōja whose name appears again at the end of the record as the son of Nūṅkamōja and as the engraver of the grant.2      The boundaries of the village are enumerated in line 45-51. They are: to the east—an ant-hill with a neem tree and, further on, a jungle; to the south-east—a tamarind tree and a junction (trikūṭṭa)3; to the south a jungle and, further on, the same jungle and a junction; in the south-west—a pit (garttā)4 and a junction; in the west –the pit called Arjuna and, further on, a mound with tamarind trees; in the north-west—a pit with circular stone; [in the north]—two pits close to each other; further on, an arjuna tree; and still further, two tamarind trees; in the north-east—an ant-hill with a neem tree; further on, a junction near a pit.      Lines 53-55 contain two benedictory and imprecatory verses, and lines 55-57 state that the charter was written by Dāmōdara, son of Mahākāyastha-sandhivigrahin Māvura, and was inscribed by Vallēmōja, son of Mahākshaśālin Nūṅkamōja. Dāmōdara and Vallēmōja are also mentioned in the Chicacole plates of Vajrahasta III as well as in the Korni plates of Anantavarman Chōḍagaṅga.5 Butt our record gives the name of Vallēmōja’s father also.      Of the geographical names in the record, Kaliṅganagara is well known. Kōluvartani-vishaya, in which the gift village of Avarēṁga was situated, is known from many records6 and seems to represent the whole or part of the modern Srikakulam Taluk. Avarēṁga is to be identified with modern Avaliṅgi which is situated at a distance of only one mile to the east of Boḍḍapāḍu where the plates were discovered.TEXT1Fourth Plate, First Side33 liṅgādhipati-śrīmad-Anantavarmmā Vajrahasta2dēvaḥ kuśalī samast-āmātya-pramu-39 kha-jabapadān=samāhūya samā3jñāpayati [|*] viditam=astu bhavatāṁ(tām) || Kōluvarttani-40 vi[sha]4yē |5 Avarēṁg-ākhya-grāmaḥ | chatuḥ-śī(sī)m-āvachchhinnaḥ sa-jala-sthalaḥ sarvva-pīḍā-41 vivarjjitam=ā-chandr-ārkka-kshiti-sama-kālaṁ yāvan6=mātā-pitrōr=ātmanaḥ pu-42 ṇya-yaśō-bhivṛiddhayō(yē) || Kara-vasu-nidhi-Śāk-āvdē(bdē) | Uttarāyaṇa-saṁkrā-[ntau]43 asmin grāma-nivāsinō(nē) || Jalēśvaradēvāya bhōgaṁ kṛijam7 || Vēsyā8-gōtr-ō-44 tpannaḥ Ērayamaḥ | tasya putraḥ | Māvayah | tasya bhāryyā Kaṁchapā | tayōr=jjātāya Ērayamāya45 mā(sā)dara-manavarttikaṁ9 pradattaṁ(ttam) || asy=aiva grāmasya sīmānō likhyantē || pūrvvataḥFourth Plate, Second Side46 niṁva(ba)-sahita-valmīkaḥ | parataḥ vana-chā(rā)jī | āgnēyataḥ tiṁtriṇīka-vṛiksha[ḥ*] trikū-47 ṭṭaḥ10 || dakshiṇataḥ vana-rājī | parataḥ sā vana-rājī trikūṭṭaḥ10 || nairu(rṛi)tyataḥ garttā48 trikūṭṭaḥ10 || paāchimattaḥ(taḥ) Arjun-ākhya-garttā || parataḥ tiṁtriṇīka-[vṛi]ksha-sahita-sētu49 ḥ || vāyavyataḥ maṇḍal-ākāra-pāshāṇāḥ(ṇa)-sahita-garttā | 11dvau garttau sa-50 ṁgamēva12 | parataḥ arjjuna-vṛikshaḥ | tat-parataḥ tiṁtriṇīka-vṛikshau dvau [|*]51 ī(ai)śānyataḥ niṁva(ba)-sahita-valmīkaḥ | parataḥ garttā-samīpē trikūṭṭaḥ ||52 anēna mahākshaśālayē13 Vallēmōjāyā(ya) svarṇṇa-lōha-kārī14 cha manavartik=āsmin grā-53 mē pradattā || Bhūmiṁ yaḥ pratigṛihnā(hṇā)ti yachcha(ś=cha) bhūmiṁ prayachchhati [|*] ubhau tau puṇya-Fifth Plate54 karmmāṇau niyatauṁ(taṁ) svargga-gāminau || [14*] Shashṭiṁ varsha-sahasrāṁ svarggē mōdati bhū-55 midaḥ | ākshēptā ch=ānumantā cha tāny=ēva narakē vasēt || [15*] mahākāyastha-sandhivi-56 grahi-Māvurasya sūnunā Dāmōdarēṇa likhitaṁ(tam) || mahā-yakshaśāli15-Nuṁkamō-57 ju(ja)sya sūnunā Vallēmōjēna utkīrṇṇitaṁ16 [|*]
Vol. XXXIVNo. 28—NAPITAVATAKA GRANT OF GANGA DEVENDRAVARMAN(1 Plate)G.S. Gai, Ootacamund(Received on 13.11.1958)      This copper-plate grant was secured by the Government Epigraphist for India in 1939-40 from the Pontiff of the Shri Balaga Bāvāji Maṭha at Śrīkākuḷam in the Visakhapatnam District through the Sub-Collector of Srikakulam.1 The inscription was published by Shri M. Somasekhara Sarma in the Telugu Journal Bhārati, Vol. XIV, Part ii (July 1937), pp. 67 ff. According to Shri Sarma’s information, the plates were discovered in a mound situated to the west of Chīḍivalasa which is a village about 14 miles north of Śrīkākuḷam. Another grant, issued in the Gaṅga year 397 by the Gaṅga king Dēvēndravarman who is also the donor of the present grant, was discovered at the same village.2      This is a set of three copper-plates each measuring 7·75" by 2·6". They are strung together on a ring (about ·36" in thickness and 4" in diameter), the ends of which are soldered to the two ends of a bracket forming the lower portion of a circular seal about 1·5" in diameter. The seal has the legend śrī-Dēvēndravarmā with the symbol of the crescent above and a seated bull facing left below. Below the bull is a lotus. The weight of the set is not known.      The characters are an admixture of both the Northern and Southern scripts, known as the later Kaliṅga script and found in many other records of the period and region.3 On palaeographical grounds, the inscription may be referred to the 9th or 10th Century A.D. There are very faint traces of some letters of a previous writing on the first plate and the second side of the second plate. The language is Sanskrit and contains many errors. Very often medial ā has not been indicated. Except the usual benedictory and imprecatory verses at the end, the text of the record is in prose.      The charter, issued by Mahārājādhirāja Paramēśvara Dēvēndravarman of the Gaṅga dynasty, is not dated. The king was the son of Bhūpēndravarman and was devoted to the god Gōkarṇasvāmin on the Mahēndra-giri. The grant was issued, like other records of the early Eastern Gaṅgas, from the city of Kaliṅganagara which has been identified with Mukhaliṅgam near Śrīkākuḷam. The introductory portion giving the praśasti of the king and comprising lines 1-12 of the text is the same as that of the Chīḍivalasa plates of Dēvēndravarman referred to above (lines 1-12). In both the records as well as in the Nirakarpur plates,4 the ruling king Dēvēndravarman is called the son of Bhūpēndravarman who is apparently identical with Bhūpēndravarman whose son Anantavarman Vajrahasta issued the Kalahandi plates5 dated in the Gaṅga year 383 (877-81 A.D.). So Dēvēndravarman of our record was a brother of this Anantavarman Vajrahasta and, since the Chīḍivalasa plates are dated in the Gaṅga year 397, he was possibly the younger brother. From Chīḍivalasa plates, we learn that the real name of Bhūpēndravarman was Mārasiṁha and that his father was one Vajrin, i.e. Vajrahasta. The present inscription and the Chīḍivalasa and Nirakarpur plates are the only records of king Dēvēndravarman discovered so far.      The charter is addressed by the king to the householder of the village of Nāpitavāṭaka situated in Kōluvartanī (lines 12-13). The name of this village figures again in the record as Nāyadavāṭa and Nāpitavāḍaka (lines 21 and 22). The object of the inscription (Lines 13-20) is to register the gift, made by the king, for the increase of the merit of himself and his parents, of the above-mentioned village to the brothers Narasiṁha-bhaṭṭa and Mādhava-bhaṭṭa of the Kāmakāyana or Kāmukāyani-gōtra, who were the sons of Drōṇa-bhaṭṭa and grandsons of Mādhava-bhaṭṭa. One of the donees was named after his grandfather according to a wellknown custom. The donees were well-versed in the Śastras and the Bahvṛicha-Vēda and the six Aṅgas while their father is stated to have been shaṭ-karma-nirata and well-versed in theVēdas. The gfit, which was free from all taxes, is stated to have been made on the occasion of the Uttarāyaṇa. The donees were entitled to enjoy the bhōga and bhāga.1      The boundaries of the gift village are described in lines 20-26 as follows: starting from the south-east, in the south-west, an ant-hill at the junction2 of the three villages Dibu, Siviḍi and Nāyadavāṭa (Nāpitavāṭaka); further on, a jungle or a row of trees upto a junction; still further on, another jungle or a row of trees upto an ant-hill at the junction of the villages Kandakavāṭaka, Kōlala and Nāpitavāḍaka (ovāṭaka); further, a jungle or a row of trees upto Taṭakaḍanī; further, an ant-hill in Bhāju (probably the name of a plot or site) extending upto the stone at a junction; further in the west, the stone at a junction; further in the north, a stone in a corner; further, an ant-hill to the east of Kēva (possibly the name of a locality); further in the north, a jungle or a row of trees including a pit extending upto an ant-hill at the junction in the northwest; and further, a pit.      Lines 26-29 are devoted to the benedictory and imprecatory verses attributed to Vyāsa and addressed to the future kings.      Of the geographical names, Kōluvartanī, which occurs as a vishaya in other records, is identified with the modern Srikakulam District. Nāpitavāṭaka, Nāpitavāḍaka or Nāyadavāṭa, the gift village, is mentioned as Nāpitavāḍa in connection with the description of the boundaries in the Chīḍivalasa plates. Similarly the villages Siviḍi, Kandalivāḍa and Kōlandāri referred to there in the same connection are apparently the same as Siviḍi, Kandakavāṭaka and Kōlala mentioned in the record under study. These, together with the village Dibu which is mentioned in our record in connection with the boundaries, have to be located in the Srikakulam Taluk, though I am unable to identify themTEXT3First Plate1 Svasti [|*] [Ś]rīmad-anēka-dēvakul-ākulād=Amaka(ra)pura(r-ā)nuka(kā)riṇaḥ2 kalp-ānta-saṁkalpa(lpi)t-ānalpa-jana-sampat-sampādita-mā(ma)hāmahimnā(mnō)3 mahi(hī)tala-tilakāt=Kaligaṁ(ṅga)nagarāt=prasiddha-siddha-tāpas-ādhyāsita-4 kandar-ōdara-Mahēndragiri-śikhara-śēkharasya sur-āsura-gu5 rōḥ sakala-tṛi(tri)bhuvanā(na)-mahāprāsāda-nirmmāṇ-aika-sūtradhārasya6 bhagavatō Gōkarṇṇasvāminaś=charaṇa-kamala-praṇāmād=vigata1-kali-kā-7 la-kalaṁkō Gagāṁmala2-kula-chūḍāmaṇi[ḥ*] sphu(sphū)rjjan-nija-bhuja-vājrajñā-Second Plate, First Side8 jita3-sakala-Kaligāṁdhirājyē4 mand-ānila-vēla(lā)-kula-kallōla-jaladhi-9 [r]mē(mē)khal-āvani-tal-āmala-yaśāḥ anēka-bhi(bhī)shaṇa-samara-saṁkshōbha-jani-10 ta-jaya-pratāp-āvanata-samasta-sāmanta-chaka(kra)-kirīṭa-kiraṇa-majaṁrī-pujaṁ5-ra-11 ṁjita-charaṇaḥ paramamāhēśvarō mātā-pitṛi-pada6nudhyātō mahārāja(jā)dhi-12 rāda(ja)-paramēśvara-śrīmad-Bhūpēndravarmma-sūnu-śrī-Dēvēndravarmma(rmmā) || Kōluva[r*]ttanyā[ṁ*]13 Na(Nā)pitavāṭaka-grāma-vāsinaḥ kuṭuṁbinas=samājñāpayati viditam=astu vō14 yath=āyaṁ dharmmō7 ma(mā)tā-pitrōr=ātmanaś=cha puṇy-ābhivṛi[ddhayē] || a[śē]sha-guṇa-gaṇ-ā-Second Plate, Second Side15 dhārasya Mādhava-bhaṭṭasya pautrābhyāṁ shaṭ-karmma-niratasya vidita-sakala-vē-16 d-ārtthasya Drōṇa-bhaṭṭasya putrābhyā[ṁ*] shaḍhaśaṁ(ḍaṁga)-sahita-Bahvṛicha-vēda-pāragābhyāṁ(bhyām)17 avagat-āśēsha-śastrartthabhyāṁ8 Kāmukāyana9-sagōtrābhyā[ṁ*] Narasiṁha-bhaṭṭa-[Mā]dhava-18 bhaṭṭābhyām=mayā ayaṁ grāmas=sa[r*]vva-kara-parihāṁrēṇa cha kattakam10= uttara-(rā)ya-19 ṇa-nimittē udaka-pūrvvakaṁ sampradatta iti yath-ōdita-bhōga-bha(bhā)gam=u-20 panayantas=sukhaṁ prativasatē(th=ē)ti || saṁ(sa)mprati prā[g*]-da(dā)kshiṇyēna sīma(mā)-li[ṁ]gāni likhyantē [|*]21 īśō (aiśā)nyāṁ [Di]bu-Siviḍi-Nāyadavāṭa-trikūṭē valmīkaḥ tatō vana-ra(rā)jī ya(yā) vatti-(t-tri)ku(kū)[ṭṭa*]mThird Plate22 tatō=pi vana-rājī yāvat=Kandakavāṭaka-Kōlala-Nāpitavāḍaka-grō(grā)ma(mā) ṇā[ṁ*] trika(kū)-23 ṭē valmīkaḥ(kaṁ) tatō=pi vana-rā[jī*] yāvat=Taṭakaḍanī[ṁ*] tatō=pi Bhāju-sthitā(ta)-va-l[mī]kaṁ(kaḥ) ya(yā)va[t*]24 trikūṭē śilā[m*] | tataḥ paśchimataḥ trikūṭē śila(lā) | tata uttarataḥ kōṇē śilā | tataḥ25 Kē[vā]t=pūrvvataḥ valmīkaḥ | tata uttarataḥ garttāsahitā vana-rājī yāvad=vāyavyā[ṁ*]26 triku(kū)ṭē valmīkaḥ(kaṁ) tatō ga[r*]ttā || bhavishyad-bhūpānva(n=vi) jñapa[ya*]ti Vya(Vyā)-sa-vacha[n]aiḥ || Bahubhi[r*]=vvasudhā27 dattā ra(rā)jabhis=Saśa(ga)r-ādibhiḥ [|*] yasya yasya yadā bhūmis=tasya tadā phalaṁ-| (lam ||) Sva-rda(da)ttām=pa-28 ra-dattāṁ vā yatnād=raksha Yu[dhi*]sṭhika(ra) || ( | ) mahi(hī)m=mahimatāṁ śrēṭṭa(shṭha) dānāt śrē(ch=chhrē)yō=nupa(pā)lana[m ||*] [Sha]shṭiṁ29 varsha-sahasra(srā)ṇāṁ svarggē tishṭhati-bhūvi(mi)daḥ [|*] ākshēptā ch=ānumā(ma) ntā cha tāny=ēva naraka(kē) vā(va)[sēt ||]1 Read idaṁ tāmra-patra-shaṭkaṁ śrīmat-para mahaṁsa-parivrājakāchārya-Bhōgavardhana-pīṭh-ādhīśa-jagadguru-daṁḍi-Bālabrahmānaṁdasarasvatīsvāmināṁ padēshv-arpitam.2 In Oriyā ś is usually pronounced as s. Note also the contractions nra for nara, pti for pati, gōchrē for gōcharē.3 The latest definitely known date of the king is Śaka 1324 (= 31st Aṅka or 25th regnal year). See S.I.I., Vol. VI, No. 1016. He may not have been living in Śaka 1328 when his wife Pārvatī-mahādēvī  made a gift in favour of the god Narasiṁha of Simhachalam (ibid., No. 731). Subba Rao (J.A.H.R.S., Vol. VIII, pp. 70 ff.) takes 1414 A.C. to be the last year of the king’s reign as another of his wives, named Nīladēvī, made a gift in favour of the same god in Śaka 1335 (S.I.I., Vol. VI, No. 1072). But this is uncertain as the queen seems to have been a widow at the time of the grant. A recent suggestion that the king died in 1409 A.C. (cf. J.O.R., Vol. XIX, p. 135) is based on a misunderstanding of the evidence of S.I.I., Vol. V, No. 1205, which belongs to the reign of Bhānu III and not of Bhānu IV as is wrongly supposed.1 Cf. Ind. Ant., Vol. XXV, p. 285.2 See J.O.R., Vol. XVII, pp. 209-15. It is very probable that a substitute was installed after the original image of Purushōttama-Jagannātha, established in the Gaṅga palace at Cuttack by Anaṅgabhīma III, had been carried away by Sulṭān Fīrūz Shāh of Delhi.1 See J.A.S.B., Vol. LXII, 1893, Part I, pp. 91, 93, 96, 99, 100.2 Cf. Mādalā Pāñjī, ed. A.B. Mahānti, Cuttack, 1940, pp. 27, 28, 30. Unfortunately, Mr. Mahānti has absolutely nothing to say about the meaning of such words, inspite of the fact that they are not recognized even in the voluminous Pramōda Abhidhāna (pp. 2891) published in 1942.3 Op. cit., p. 28. Some of the officers known from our record are also mentioned in several other inscriptions of the time of Narasiṁha IV. Cf. J.A.H.R.S., Vol. VIII, pp. 70 ff.1 I am doubtful whether this kai is the same as the accusative-dative suffix ku found in Pl. VI B, 1. 14, Pl. VII, 1. 4.2 Cf. ē-avaīa namāna ē-bhōga-dēśa yē haraï sē Jagannāthaṅku drōha karaï (J.A.S.B., Vol. LXII, 1893, Part I, p. 91)3 For āvēdana or āvadāna meaning ‘tax’ in an Orissan record, see Journ. Bomb. Hist. Soc., Vol. VI. P. 107, to which my attention was drawn by Mr. K.B. Tripathi.1 From Telugu-Kannaḍa jita (from Sanskrit jīvita), ‘pay, wages’. The Mādalā Pāñjī (op. cit., p. 29) also uses jita in the sense of revenue-income.1 See J.R.A.S.B., Letters, Vol. XVII, pp. 19-26.2 Cf. Ray, D.H.N.I., Vol. I, p. 492.3 See my paper on the Nagarī plates of Anaṅgabhīma III, above, pp. 235 ff.4 The officer may have written the document on the plates with ink or point to facilitate the work of engraving Cf. Indian Archives, Vol. V, p. 5.1 From the original plates and their impressions.2 Sanskrit Vṛiśchika-śukl-aikādaśyāṁ.3 Sanskrit abhyantara-nagarē.4 Oriyā māhā stands for Sanskrit mahā.5 The letters gra and ka had been omitted originally but were later inserted, the former below the line and the latter compressed between the preceding and following letters.6 The reading may be mudrayā. In that case, mudra is used for mudala found elsewhere in the same context.7 Sanskrit utsṛijya.8 In the left margin. This has a different form than that of 6 at the left margin of the reverse of Plate VI of the Kendupatna plates (set I) of Narasimha II (J.A.S.B., Vol. LXV, 1896, Part I, Plate XVIII).9 The letter mi had been originally omitted and was later imperfectly formed between the preceding and following letters. The word bhūmi is, however, unnecessary in the context.10 Sanskrit Vṛiśchika. The letter dvi has really been written with d having both medial i and u.11 This vi is redundant. Thāu=ētēshu sthitēshu of Plate VIA, lines 23-24.12 Sanskrit mahāsēnāpati.1 Better read dēulī-bhūmi |; cf. line 22 below. But the text as it is may also be justified; cf. line 26 below.2 The letter thē is redundant.3 I prefer hijala to dvi-jala at the suggestion of Mr. K.B. Tripathi.4 The name of the river is unnecessarily repeated.5 Possibly ādi kari is intended.6 i.e., Dakshiṇa-Rāḍa-saōgrāma.7 The space expected to be covered by the name of the river referred to is left blank with the only exception of small stroke. Apparently it was intended to supply the name later.8 Possibly we have to add the expression ādi kari after adha.1 The difference in the forms of some letters on this plate from those of the previous lines may suggest that this plate was engraved by a different person. There are numerous errors in the writing on this plate.2 The daṇḍas are unnecessary.3 It seems that the reading intended was ādi kari….paryantēkē sīmā. Thus some further indications regarding this boundary appear to have been inadvertently omitted. In adhā, dh looks like dhdh which is the form of dh in the Kaliṅga script. As to kshi (śchi), it may be pointed out that ksh is often written for chh in Oriyā inscriptions.4 Possibly sīmā-samakrānta was intended as in other places.5 Read śandhivigrahikasya. The daṇḍas are superfluous.6 Possibly the reading intended is ēk-āṁśaḥ or ēkā vāṭī.7 The metre of this verse and the following four verses is Anushtubh.8 Read dānāch=chhrēyō.9 Read kōṭara-vāsinaḥ.1 The daṇḍa is superfluous.2 The letter ma is imperfectly formed.3 Metre: Vasantatilaka.4 Metre: Anushṭubh.5 Metre: Vasantatilaka.6 Read vīchīshu for the metre’s sake.7 Metre: Sārdūlavikrīḍita. The language of the third foot of this verse is faulty.8 Read viśvataśo.9 Metre: Sragdharā.10 The intended reading seems to be sarva or bhūta.1 Above, Vol. VI, pp. 86 ff. Another such instance is the Uruvupalli grant (Ind. Ant., Vol. V, pp. 5 ff.) of the Pallava Dharma-Yuvamahārāja Vishṇugōpa; but the record is dated in the regnal year of the reigning monarch Siṁhavarman. If, however, the dating would have been in an era, as in the present case, Siṁhavarman’s name could have been omitted since it is not mentioned in the formal part of the grant. Cf. the Halsi plates of the Kadamba Yuvarāja Kākusthavarman, probably dated in the Gupta year 80 (Suc. Sāt., p. 334). For a grant issued by a Mahāyuvarāja, see B.Ch. Chhabra, Antiquities of Chamba State, Part II, p. 64.2 Above, Vol. XXX, pp. 18 ff.3 Ibid., Vol. XXIII, pp. 73 ff.4 Ibid., Vol. XVIII, pp. 312 ff. As the date is written in this record as śata-mayē daś-ōttarē, it was not quite certain that the intended reading is really śata-trayē daś-ōttarē (i.e. in the year 310). No doubt on this point can, however, be entertained after the publication of the Indian Museum plates issued in the year 308. That the two records belong to one and the same Gaṅga king is clear from the fact that the same scribe and engraver are mentioned in both the charters. The Indian Museum epigraph was written by Rahasya (i.e. Rahasyādhikṛita) Sarvachandra and engraver by Akshaśālin śrī-Sāmanta Khaṇḍimala, while the writer of the Tekkali charter was śrī-Sāmanta Sarvachandra and its engraver Akshaśālin śrī-Sāmanta Khaṇḍimala. The undated Chicacole (Srikakulam) plates (JAS, Letters, Vol. XVIII, 1952, pp. 17 ff.) of the same king were also written and engraver by the said persons, viz., Sarvachandra-śrī-sāmanta and śrī-sāmanta-Khaṇḍimala. The official designation Rahasya also occurs in the Chicacole (Srikakulam) plates (Ind. Ant., Vol. XIV, pp. 11-12 and Plate) of Satyavarman, the first son of Dēvēndravarman and successor of Rājēndravarman of our inscription. This record is dated in the Gaṅga year 351 which was at first wrongly read.5 A.R.Ep., 1923-24, pp. 97-98; Journ. Or. Res., Vol. IX, 1935, pp. 59-63.6 A.R.Ep., 1917-18, Appendix A, No. 13 (cf. p. 137).1 In the records of Dēvēndravarman the expression śrī-Sāmanta is used as an epithet of both the scribe and the engraver. In this case, however, Sāmanta looks like the personal name of the scribe unless it is believed that the personal name was omitted after the epithet through oversight. An Amātya Śrī-Sāmanta seems to have been the scribe of the Tekkali plates of Anantavarman (second son of Dēvēndravarman, predecessor of Rājēndravarman of the inscription under study), dated year 358 (above, Vol. XXVIII, p. 311).2 The engraver of the records is stated to have been the son of one Maüchandra who seems to have been related to Dāmachandra. Maüchandra may also be a wrong reading for Dāmachandra.3 Cf. Kōrāsōḍaka-pañchālī in the Koroshanda plates of Viśākhavarman (above, Vol. XXI, pp. 23 ff.) and the Chicacole (Srikakulam) plates of Indravarman (Ind. Ant., Vol. XIII, pp. 122 ff.). Pushyagiri-pañchālī is called a vishaya in the Sudava plates of Dēvēndravarman (above, Vol. XXVI, pp. 62 ff).4 From the original plates.5 Expressed by symbol.6 Read sarv-artu. There is trace of a letter, originally incised and later erased, between rva and rtu.7 The sign meant for the letter ma has a peculiar form.1 The original shows an unnescessary ē-mātrā with ka.2 Read śaśāṅka-chūḍāmaṇēro. The akshara sā is engraved on an erasure.3 In this word ka has an unusual shape owing to the addition of an unnecessary stroke somewhat resembling an ā-mātrā, while la is incised on an erased yu.4 Read ohava-saṅkshōbha in which s and ksh have peculiar forms.5 Read śabdah.6 Read chūḍāmaṇi.7 Read nistriṁśa-dhāro.8 The akshara rga is written on an erasure.9 Read dākshiṇya-śaury-audārya.10 Read śrī or correctly śry-Ao.11 Read omaṭṭamb-āo.12 The intended reading is bhavatāṁ which is, however, redundant in view of the use of vō. Read instead asmābhih.1 Read pañchālyāṁ.2 Read mātrā.3 Read pradattaḥ or pradattau.4 Read bhaṭṭārikāyai.5 Better read ā-chandr-ārka-pratishṭhaṁ (or pratishṭhān) kṛitvā.6 Read pitrōr=ātmanao.7 The superscript of the conjunct is written on an erasure.8 The word naidhāni seems to be derived from Sanskrit nidhāna and to have been used to indicate ‘a boundary pillar’. Better read nidhanao for naidhāni here and below. [The correct form would be naidhānī.—Ed.]9 Read dattāṁ vā.10 These letters, engraved between the beginning of the previous and following lines are not in a regular line of writing.11 Read Mā bhūd=a-phala-śaṅkā.12 This word is redundant.13 Read sakalao.14 Read oudāhritañ=cha buddhvā.1 The intended reading is purushēṇa; but read purushaiḥ for the sake of the metre.2 Read Gāṅgēya-vaṁśa.3 Read saṁvatsara-śata.4 Read osandhivigrahika-śrī.5 Read Svāmio. Instead of the ā-mātrā of Sā, the engraver seems to have incised what looks like a second i-mātrā of mi.6 Read ośālinā.7 This letter and the punctuation mark are incised below the end of the previous line.1 The same scholar has again noticed them in English in JAHRS, Vol. XXI, pp. 113ff.2 See above, Vol. IX, pp. 96 ff. and Plates; ibid., Vol. XXIII, pp. 67 ff. and Plates; ibid., Vol. XXXI, pp. 305 ff. and Plates.3 Besides the present grant, I have listed eight more records of this king. They are, (1) Nadagam plates, Śaka 979 (above, Vol. IV, pp. 183 ff); (2) Madras Museum plates, Śaka 984 (ibid., Vol. IX, pp. 94 ff); (3) Narasapatam plates, Śaka 967 (ibid., Vol. XI, pp. 147 ff.); (4) Ganjam plates, Śaka 991 (ibid., Vol. XXIII, pp. 67 ff.); (5) Peddabammidi plates, Śaka 982 (ibid., Vol. XXXI, pp. 305 ff.); (6) Chikkalavalasa plates, Śaka 982 (below, Vol.XXXIII, pp. 141 ff.); (7) Chicacole plates, Śaka 971 (JAHRS, Vol. VIII, pp. 163 ff.); and (8) Boddapāḍu plates, Śaka 982 (Kaḷingadēśacharita, Appendix, pp. 55 ff.).1 The expression uttara-niyōga is taken in this sense here, though the word niyōga which occurs later in the record seems to have been used in a technical sense meaning ‘a unit’. See note 2 below.2 The word niyōga is suffixed to the proper names here and in similar expressions in the sequel. It is difficult to make out their exact significance. Possibly the portions granted were known by these names at the time of the grant.3 Probably Śiriyapa-nāyaka was dead at the time and so his son gets only one share while his brothers get eighteen shares.4 (Added from correction) The reading of the name read as Apētana may also be Ayitama.1 The expression which occurs in this connection is Mārēṇḍigrāmaḥ Arisavalli-grāmaṁ pravēśya pradattaḥ. For the interpretation of the word prāvēśya or pravēśa in this context, see Dr. Sircar’s article on Chidivalasa plates of Dēvēndravarman, JAS, Letter, Vol. XVIII, p. 78, note 1.2 These make only five shares; the remaining three shares are not accounted for.3 Also called Bhaddi-nāyaka.4 From the original plates and impressions.5 Expressed by symbol.6 The portion given in the brackets is damaged.1 The metre is faulty; cf. above, Vol. XXIII, p. 71, note 14.2 There is an ā-mātrā attached to this akshara which seems to have been cancelled by the engraver.1 Cf. nisarga-bhinn-āspadam=ēka-saṁstham=asmin=dvayaṁ Śrīś=cha Sarasvatī cha (Raghuvaṁśa, VI, 29).2 One va is redundant.3 This daṇḍa in unnecessary.4 This plate contains one more line of writing after this, which is erased. The engraving is not deep as it is elsewhere and the reading seems to be the continuation of this line with syāṁ Sōmavārē Uśiki-grāma-nivāsī…...1 Read yaś=ch=ōo.2 Read ovya etado.3 This daṇḍa is unnecessary.4 Sandhi has not been observed here.5 The two letters after sya may be read as bhāryyā. The akshara preceding pā seems to be rva and there is only one letter before that. The proper name may be restored as Sarvapā.1 This daṇḍa is unnecessary.2 Read nāyakābhyām=.3 The intended reading seems to be omatēna.4 Read olair=Manun=ōkta.o 5 About three aksharas are lost here.6 The expression manavarttika is possibly the same as Telugu manuvṛitti, manuvarti or manōvarti interpreted by Brown as ‘maintenance, support or allowance’. It occurs also in the Boḍḍapāḍu plates of Vajrahasta III which are being edited in this journal.1 Cf. above, Vol. XXXII, pp. 310 ff.; Vol. XXXIII, pp. 141 ff.2 Cf. ibid., Vol. XXXII, pp. 310.1 Ibid., Vol. XXXI, pp. 305 ff.; Vol. XXXIII, pp. 141 ff.; Vol. XXXII, pp. 310 ff.2 I am indebted to Dr. D.C. Sircar for some suggestions as regards the nature of the grant.3 Trikūṭa may meant the meeting place of three boundaries, roads, etc. Cf. JAS, Letters, Vol. XVIII, p. 79 and note 1.4 Gartā also means a canal or watercourse.5 JAHRS, Vol. VIII, p. 176; Vol. I, pp. 46.6 Above, Vol. IV, pp. 183 ff.; Vol. XXXI, pp. 305 ff.; Vol. XXXIII, pp. 141 ff.1 From impressions. Lines 1-37 are engraved on the first three plates. The text is the same as in the donor’s other records. The verse Anuragēṇa,etc. ends in line 36 and is followed by the passage Kaliṅganagarāt=paramamāhēśvara-paramabhaṭṭāraka-maharājādhirāja-Triṁ(Tri)kao in lines 36-37.2 This akshara is written above ha between two small daṇḍas.3 This akshara is written below the line between two small daṇḍas and indicated by a cross above the line.4 This akshara is damaged.5 This and most of the other marks of punctuation in this and the following lines are necessary.6 The word is redundant.7 Read bhōgaḥ kṛitaḥ.8 Read Vaiśya. Cf. above, Vol. XXIII, p. 73, note 6.9 The word is manavarttikā in line 52 below.10 Read trikūṭṭaś=cha.11 The expression uttarataḥ may be supplied here.12 Read saṅgatau.13 Read ośalinē.14 Read kāriṇē.15 Read mahākshao.16 Read utkīrnṇam.1 See ARSIE, 1939-40, App. A, No. 16.2 JAS, Letters, Vol. XVIII, pp. 77 ff.3 Ibid., pp. 47 ff. and Plates.4 JBRS, Vol. XXXV pp. 1 ff.5 Above, Vol. XXXI, pp. 317 ff.1 For the meaning of these two words, cf. JAS, Letters, Vol. XVIII, p. 79.2 For trikūṭa, the other forms of which are trikuṭa and trikuṭṭa, see loc.cit.3 From impressions.1 The Chīḍivalasa plates read kamala-saṁbhava-salila-kshālita.2 Read Gaṁg-āmala.3 Read vajr-ōpārjita.4 Read Kaliṁg-ādhirājyō.5 Read maṁjarī-puṁja.6 Read pād-āo.7 This may be a mistake for grāmō (see JAS, Letters Vol. XVIII, p. 80, note 3). But the word is unnecessary as it occurs in line 18 below.8 Read śāstr-ārthābhyāṁ.9 The correct name of the gōtra is Kāmakāyana or Kāmukāyani.10 The intended reading may be sarvva-kara-parihāraṁ cha kṛitvā.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
