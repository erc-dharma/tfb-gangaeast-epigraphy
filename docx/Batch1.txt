Sircar, Ootacamund, and P. Acharya, Bhubaneswar      Pandit Ratnākara Gargavaṭu (ordinarily Garābaru) of Bhubaneswar (Puri District, Orissa), who died in 1953, was an enthusiastic student of Indian epigraphy in his youth. About the year 1902, when he was engaged in studying the stone inscriptions fixed in the compound wall of the Ananta-Vāsudēva temple at Bhubaneswar, one Rāmadāsa Bābājī informed Pandit Gargavaṭu that he had seen a set of copper plates bearing writing similar to the stone inscriptions with which the Pandit was then engaged. On the Pandit pressing for further information about the plates, the Bābājī came to him after a few days with the news that the Pandit’s cousin Harēkṛishṇa Sāmantarāya knew the whereabouts of the copper plates and might be of help in securing them for his examination. When Harēkṛishṇa was approached, he informed the Pandit that the plates were in the possession of Mukunda Sāmantarāya of the village of Alalpur (Alarpur of the Survey of India map, sheet No. 73-H/15) lying about four miles east of Bhubaneswar to the left of the Puri road. Pandit Gargavaṭu then saw Mukunda Sāmantarāya and learnt from him that the plates had been found in a stone-box which had been discovered while digging the foundation for a house in the village. The plates were seven in number and were strung together on a ring bearing a seal with the bull emblem. Mukunda Sāmantarāya was found to have put them by the side of his family deity along with which they were being worshipped by him daily. At the Pandit’s request Mukunda agreed to lend the plates for the decipherment of the inscription and Pandit Gargavaṭu carried them to his place personally, although they were very heavy.1 The Pandit’s then made a serious attempt to decipher the next of the inscription and completed his transcript of the record after some time.2 At the time Pandit Gargavaṭu was serving as a teacher in the Balasore School. A fellow teacher at the school, named Rādhākṛishṇa Basu, who was a Sanskritist and an M.A., later made some corrections in his transcript with the help of the text of a similar inscription published in the Viśvakōsha, s.v. Gāṅgēya.3      Some time after completing the preparation of the transcript, Pandit Gargavaṭu engaged a mūliā (day labourer) to carry the plates from his home at Bhubaneswar to Mukunda Sāmantarāya at Alalpur. Mukunda, however, became full of sorrow and indignation when he found the plates, which he had been worshipping regularly along with his family deity, thus defiled by the touch of a labourer of low caste. Considering them unworthy of veneration any longer, he sold the set to a coppersmith and it was ultimately melted by the latter. The inscription thus lost now exists only in Pandit Gargavaṭu’s transcript (with corrections later inserted by Rādhākṛishṇa Basu and himself) from which we are editing it with the Pandit’s kind permission.4 As regards the fairly reliable nature of the transcript, it may be pointed out that there are fortunately cases where the genuineness of the Pandit’s reading can be verified. By way of illustration, we may refer to the passage śēvāyaty-Allālanāthaśarmmaṇē as read by N.N. Vasu in line 18 on the first side of plate VI of the Kendupatna inscription published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1896, part i, p. 256. Vasu took the word śēvāyaty to be the same as Bengali sevāyita meaning a person in charge of the worship of a deity in temple.1 But an examination of the impressions of the plates published by Vasu clearly shows that the correct reading of the passage is śē(sē)nāpati-Allālanāthaśarmmaṇē. It has to be noticed that the same Sēnāpati (general) Allālanāthaśarman is also twice mentioned in the Alalpur inscription under review in lines 213 and 228 where Pandit Gargavaṭu reads the passages, no doubt correctly, as Allālanātha-sēnāpatayē and Allālanātha-sēnāpatinā. The names of the village read by the Pandit as Hariōntāgrāma (modern Harianta), Chhatalōgrāma (modern Chhatol), Kurāṅgagrāma (modern Kurang) and Khandhalagrāma (modern Khandol) similarly point to the reliable nature of his transcript. Of course it cannot be said that the Pandit’s transcript is absolutely free from misreadings.      The plates are known to have been seven in number. Pandit Gargavaṭu numbers the line in his transcript separately according to the inscribed sides of the plates. This shows, as expected, that the first and seventh plates were inscribed only on the inner sides, while the other plates had writing on both the sides. There were altogether 228 line of writing. The first and second sides of Plate IV had respectively 17 and 18 lines engraved on them, while the first side of plate V and the inner side of plate VII had respectively 19 and 14 lines. The remaining eight inscribed faces of the copper plates had each twenty lines of writing on them.      The record contains two dates. The first of them refers to the time when the grant was actually made by king Narasiṁha II, while the second falls about two years later when the documents was written and the plates were engraved. The first date is given as the expired Śaka year 1215 as well as the king’s nineteenth Aṅka. Kumbha-dvitīya, badi 5, Tuesday. Kumbha-dvitīya indicates the second day of the solar month of Phālguna. In Śaka 1215, however, the second day of solar Phālguna fell on Tuesday, the 26th January, 1294; but the tithi on that date was Māgha badi 14 and not Phālguna badi 5. In that year, Phālguna badi 5 actually fell on Tuesday, the 16th February, which was the 23rd and not the 2nd day of the solar month of Phālguna. The date of our record thus seems to be irregular; it is either the 26th of January or the 16th of February in 1294 A.D. The nineteenth Aṅka year of king Narasiṁha II was his sixteenth regnal year (omitting according to rule, the first, sixth and sixteenth years). This agrees with the fact known from other records that Narasiṁha II ascended the throne in Śaka 1200 (1278 A.D.). The second date of our inscription simply speaks of the king’s twentysecond Aṅka, i.e. eighteenth regnal (omitting the first, sixth, sixteenth and twentieth years), which apparently fell in Śaka 1217. The grant was made when the king was staying at Remuṇā-kaṭaka, i.e. the city of Remuṇā or the royal camp or residence at Remuṇā, which was the place wherefrom the Kendupatna plates of Śaka 1217 (or 1218) were also issued. In the expression Śrī-charaṇēna vijaya-samayē used in this connection, śrī-charaṇa is an honorific expression to indicate the king and vijaya has been used in its Oriya sense of ‘stay’2. In the same context other records of Narasiṁha II read vijay-āvasarē. The mudala (i.e. the royal order regarding the grant or its execution) passed through the Purō-Parīkshaka-Pātra Trilōchana-jēnā who seems have been an official of a minister’s rank and was the principal inspector attached to some administrative department. The object of the grant was the increase of the king’s longevity, health, wealth and majesty. The donee was the Kōsh-ādhyaksha (treasurer) Halāyudha who was a Brāhmaṇa of the Vatsa gōtra having the Bhārgava, Chyāvana, Āpnuvat,Aurva and Jāmadagnya pravaras and was a student of a portion of the Kāṇva branch of the Yajurvēda. The area of the land granted was one hundred vāṭikās in five plots scattered in different villages.      The first plot of land comprised the village of Yanvachāpaṭigrāma (or Pandhao) in the Vāhattari khaṇḍa of the Kalamvö (mbō) ra vishaya, with the exception of the land belonging to the śāsana (land granted by a charter) pertaining to Rāma-pratirāja. The area of the land was determined according to the vala, i.e. measurement of area, done by Allāla-nāyaka, described as a śrī-karaṇa, i.e. a scribe. The western boundary of the village granted was the daṇḍā of Paṅgapāla lying to the east of a river, while the eastern boundary was western daṇḍā of Urisō-parakōṇā. The word daṇḍā means ‘a boundary pillar’ and from that ‘a boundary line’. It is tempting to equate parakōṇā with the well-known Parganā meaning a tract of land comprising a number of villages, although Parakōṇā may have also been the name of a locality adjacent to or included in Urisō. The northern boundary of Yanvachāpaṭigrāma (or Pandha?) was the southern daṇḍā of Urisōgrāma, while the southern boundary was the daṇḍ-ärddha, i.e. a portion (arddha) of the boundary line (daṇḍā), of Kuṇḍalēśvaradēva (i.e. the temple area of the deity of that name) of the Śrīrāmapura śāsana (i.e. the gift village of the name). The land within these four boundaries measured 24 vāṭikās, 19 mānas and 5 guṇṭhas. Out of this, an area measuring 8 vāṭikās and 12 mānas, which was covered by the land previously granted to gods and Brāhmaṇas and by the boundaries of a waiting place for ferry as well gōhari and gōpatha meaning broad pathways for cattle, etc., was subtracted, leaving a total (niravakara) of 16 vāṭikās, 7 mānas and 5 guṇṭhas.      The second plot of the land granted comprised the village called Kharalagrāma situated in the Sāilō vishaya. The southern boundary of this village was the dam or highway (bandha) at the northern limit of Kurāṁgagrāma, while its northern boundary was the southern daṇḍā of Hariōntāgrāma. To its west was the eastern boundary line of Chhatalōgrāma and its eastern limit touched partially the boundary of the tank attached to the gōlā (granary) belonging to Khandhalagrāma. The land within these boundaries measured 42 vāṭikās. Out of this, the area of 17 vāṭikās, 16 mānas and 20 guṇṭhas, which was covered by the boundaries around the maṇḍapa (temple or public building) under the enjoyment of gods and Brāhmaṇas and by gōhari, gōpatha, tanks, bhīṭha (mounds?), etc., was subtracted, leaving a total of 24 vāṭikās, 3 mānas and 5 guṇṭhas. The calculation here makes it clear that 1 vāṭikā of land was regarded as equal to 20 mānas 1 māna (Oriya māṇa) was equal to 25 guṇṭhas. The case is the same in Orissa even at the present time.      The third plot of the gift land comprised Gōlādalōgrāma, situated in the same Śāilō vishaya, with the exception of the locality called Lāla-Brāhmapura. The northern boundary of the village touched parts of the boundary line of the Siṁpalō-Vāṅkēśvara haṭṭa (market-place) and the southern boundary was the gōlā-pushkariṇī (tank attached to the granary) of Hariōntāgrāma. The western limit touched partly the boundary line of Nibhayapura, while the eastern limit was the western embankment of the tank of or at Pālēhā Rādgalapura (Rāṅgao?). The land measured 70 vāṭikās, 13 mānas and 15 guṇṭhas. Out of this, an area of 33 vāṭikās, 5 mānas and 1 guṇṭha, which was covered by the land such as that around maṭhas (colleges) and maṇḍapas under the enjoyment of gods and Brāhmaṇas of the locality called Haṭṭapura-karmi-daṇḍā (a certain part of Haṭṭapura) as well as by a vaidya-daṇḍā (boundaries of land granted to the local physician), tanks, jōḍa (canals), gōpatha, etc., was subtracted, leaving the total remainder of 37 vāṭikās, 8 mānas and 14 guṇṭhas.      The fourth plot of the land granted comprised Sarpadalōgrāma in the same Śāilō vishaya. It was bounded in the north by the gambhīra-vila-vēṇā (a piece of very low land covered by the vēṇā grass) of Gōlādalōgrāma and in the south the southern dyke of the tank of or at Jayagaṅga. Its western boundary was the locality called Malisāhāra-Tālapadīā in the village of Gōlādalō and the eastern limit was the maṇḍapa belonging to one Śrīdhara Viśvāla (meaning originally ‘a village watchman’, later stereotype into a family name) lying to the west of Rādgalapura (or Rāṅgao?). Within these four boundaries the land measured 11 vāṭikās and 5 guṇṭhas. Out of this, an area measuring 5 vāṭikās and covering some tanks in the possession of gods and Brāhmaṇas, was subtracted, leaving a total of 6 vāṭikās and 5 guṇṭhas.      The fifth plot of land comprised the village called Vāsidrāma in the Sāivīra vishaya with the exception of 3 vāṭikās, 4 mānas and 10 guṇṭhas attached to the homestead land belonging to the god Bhuvanēśvara worshipped at Dhārapura. The remaining land measured, according to the samākrānta-nala, 29 vāṭikās, 5 mānas and 12 guṇṭhas. In Oriya, the word samākrānta means ‘endowed with boundaries’ and nala ‘measurement of area’. It seems that the recognised area of the piece of land was quoted in this case without fresh measurement. Out of the above area, 13 vāṭikās and 15 mānas, which covered tanks, bhīṭhas and maṇḍapas in the occupation of gods and Brāhmaṇas, was subtracted leaving, according to the document under review, a total of 16 vāṭikās. There is, however, strictly speaking, a mistake in the calculation, as the remainder was actually 15 vāṭikās, 5 mānas and 12 guṇṭhas and not exactly 16 vāṭikās.      The document goes on to say that the total area of the five plots measuring 100 vāṭikās was granted as a revenue-free gift together with the right to enjoy both land and waters as well as fish and tortoise. The actual total area of the five plots, however, was slightly less than 100 vāṭikās. It was 99 vāṭikās, 4 mānas and 16 guṇṭhas, although, if the wrong calculation of the area of the fifth plots as quoted in the document is taken into account it would come up to 99 vāṭikās, 19 mānas and 4 guṇṭhas.      Sēnāpati (general) Allālanātha, who was a Brāhmaṇa of the Pūtimāsha gōtra and a student of the Śākala branch of the Rigvēda, was the Sāsanādhikārin, i.e. the head of the record department who was responsible for writing the śāsana or charter. He received, apparently as his perquisite, two vāṭikās of land consisting partly of homestead land and partly of land under water. The engraver of the plates, whose name was Pannāḍi-raṇā, similarly received two vāṭikās of land, half of which was homestead land, the other half being under water. He was apparently the same as Pannāḍi, mentioned in the Kendupatna plates, and Pannāḍi-mahāraṇā who engraved the Puri plates1 of Bhānu II, son of the issuer of the present charter. Raṇā and Mahāraṇā indicate family names among the artisans of Orissa.      A number of rent-paying subjects were also attached to the present gift land which was styled Allālapura-śāsana. The later Gaṅga monarch often gave a particular name to the land granted by a charter. Why the present charter was called Allālapura-śāsana is not clear; but it seems to have been named after the Śāsanadhikārin Sēnāpati Allālanātha. The practice of allotting a number of rent-payers to a śāsana is also known from other records of the king. The subjects attached to the present charter were: (1) Asātī who was the son of the guḍika (manufacturer or seller of sugar) Nārāyaṇa and belonged to the Uchabhāpaḍā haṭṭa (market); (2) Mādhī-śrēshṭhin who was the grandson of Bhratī-śrēshṭhin and was a potter of the Yaïtrapaḍā haṭṭa; (3) Kāliyā who was the grandson of Gōpāladānu and belonged to the Saragaḍā navā(ra)-haṭṭa; (4) Pārakhaśrēshṭhin who was the son of Jāgulï-śrēshṭhin and was an oilman of Vōirōā-gōpāpa; (5) Punakara who was the grandson of Pratōsva and a grower or seller of betel leaves attached to the Jaṅkhēra-Jayapura haṭṭa; (6) Dharmmu-śrēshṭhin who was the grandson of Kukāmāchaṇḍā and was a relation of the oilman Gabhu-raṇā of Uthalī, and (7) Maikraā, the grandson of Mārttaṇḍa and a goldsmith of the Vijayalakshmīpura haṭṭa: he was made a substitute for Uṭjās-ādhyaksha who was the grandson of the goldsmith Visu-mahalāka2 and belonged to the Vāraṅga haṭṭa and who had been attached to the śāsana of Khaḍgagrāhi-Mahāpātra Yāgānanda of Ghaṭavaṭa; and  Uṭjās-ādhyaksha was attached to the present charter.      The last line of the charter says that it was written by the Śāsanādhikārin Allālanātha-sēnāpati and that the plates were udghāṭita (probably meaning utkīrṇa or engraved) by the copper-smith Pannāḍi-raṇā.      Of the geographical names mentioned in the charter, Allālapura is, of course, modern Alalpur near Bhubaneswar. It is, however, difficult to determine as to which of the gift villages has to be identified with the present Alalpur. Another interesting fact is that only one of the five localities granted seems to have carried the name applied to the śāsana. If the reference to the god Bhuvanēśvara at Dhārapura actually refers to the present Bhubaneswar, originally name, no doubt, after a deity of this name, it may be suggested that the fifth plot of the gift land comprised modern Alalpur near Bhubaneswar. Rēmuṇā has been identified with the modern village of the same name situated about 6 miles to the west of Balasore. Paṅgapāla may be identified with the place of that name in Parganā Barpalla in the Cuttack District. Urisō is the same as Urisa, a village within the jurisdiction of the Jagatsingpur Police Station in the same District. The Sāilō vishaya may be roughly identified with the Sāilō Pargana in the said District. Sāivīra is still the name of another Parganā in that District. Kalambōra-vishaya, known from several other inscriptions, was apparently the district round the present village of Urisa.      Of the localities mentioned in connection with the second plot of the gift land, the villages Hariōntā, Kurāṅga, Chhatalō and Khandhala are now called Harianta, Kurang, Chhatol and Khandol respectively. They are all situated in the vicinity of one another in the Cuttack District (see Survey of India map, sheet No. 73 H/15). The third plot of land was also situated near Hariōntāgrāma, i.e. modern Harianta. The other places mentioned in the record cannot be satisfactorily identified.TEXT1Sixth Plate, First Side178 …….Śaka-nṛipatēḥ pañcḥadaś-ādhika-dvādaśa-śa-179 ta-samva (saṁva) tsarēshu gatēshu

No. 7- MADAGRAMA GRANT OF DEVENDRAVARMAN AND BHIMAKHEDI(1 Plate)R.C. Majumdar, Nagpur      This is a set of three copper plates which the Tahsildar of Srikakulam received from Mr. Manda Narasimham and forwarded to the Government Epigraphist for India. I edit it from a set of excellent estampages kindly supplied by the latter.      Each of the three plates measures 7.8" by 3.6". They were held together by a ring with a seal containing the emblem of a fish flanked on the sides by an ańkaśa and the crescent moon. The first and third plates are written on one side only, containing respectively ten and nine lines, while the second plate has eleven lines on the first and ten on the second side. There are thus altogether forty lines of writing. The plates, together with the ring, weigh 150 tolas, the ring alone weighing 35½ tolas. The ring was cut when the plates were received for examination.      The characters belong to the variety of the North Indian alphabet normally used in the Orissan inscriptions of the tenth and eleventh centuries A.D.      The language is Sanskrit and the inscription is written throughout in prose. It abounds in mistakes both of grammar and spelling. The use of medial ī for i and s for ś seems to be almost a regular feature, though both medial i and ś are occasionally used. The word vṛiksha is written as vrīkha (line 31) and vṛikha and vrīksha (line 29), though the correct form vṛiksha is used in line 27. The nasal is often changed into anusvāra before a consonant (line 9, 10, 24). Among other peculiarities may be mentioned the use of vada for bda (line 8, 15-16).      The inscription records the grant of the village of Māḍagrāma in the Bhīlāṅgā bhōga in favour of two persons. The boundaries of the village are given in detail. The donor is Rāṇaka Bhīmakhēḍi, son of Mahāmāṇḍalika Rāṇaka Dharmakhēḍi of the Kadamba family and feudatory of Paramabhaṭṭāraka Paramēśvara Śrī-Dēvēndravarman of the Gaṅga dynasty. Both the feudatory and the suzerain are called Paramamāhēśvara or devote of Śiva, and the grant was made in Śaka 988 from Dantapura (written as Dantāpura).1 The record concludes with the usual imprecatory verses.      The suzerain as well as the feudatory rulers mentioned in the record are known from several other grants. Two of these deserve special mention, viz. the Santa-Bommali2 and Mandasa plates3 of Dharmakhēḍi.      The inscription begins	 with the usual description, first of the ruling Gaṅga king residing at Kaliṅganagara and paying devotions to Gōkarṇṇasvāmin established on the Mahēndra mountain, and then of the feudatory ruler of the Kadamba dynasty.      The first fifteen lines of the present grant agree, almost word for word, with only slight deviations here and there, with the first fifteen lines of the Mandasa plates. The rulers named and the place of issue are, however, different. The present grant was issued from Dantapura1 by the Kadamba feudatory Bhīmakhēḍi, son of Dharmakhēḍi, whose suzerain was the Gaṅga ruler Dēvēndravarman. The Mandasa plates, however, refer to Gaṅga king Anantavarman and the Kadamba feudatory Dharmakhēḍi, son of Bhīmakhēḍi,4 who issued the grant from Jayantyāpura. The Santa-Bommali plates (Simhipura grant) were issued during the reign of Dēvēndravarman, son of Anantavarman, by Dharmakhēḍi, son of Bhīmakhēḍi. The introductory portion of the record closely resembles that of the present grant which repeats almost word for word the first ten lines of the former.      A comparison of these three grants leaves no doubt that they were issued by the same feudatory family owing allegiance to the same Gaṅga family. We may thus draw up the following genealogical table of these two families.      Gaṅga family						Kadamba family      Anantavarman						Bhīmakhēḍi I      		|							|      Dēvēndravarman					Dharmakhēḍi      									|       								Bhīmakhēḍi IIDharmakhēḍi was a contemporary of both Anantavarman and Dēvēndravarman, while Bhīmakhēḍi II was a contemporary of Dēvēndravarman.      In view of this chronological sequence in the relationship of the members of the two families, the date of the present grants, viz. Śaka 988 (1066 A.D.), is of great historical importance, as it reopens the whole question of the epoch of the Gaṅga era, though there is now a general consensus of opinion among scholars that it has to be placed during the last decade of the fifth century A.D.1      In an article contributed to the Indian Culture,2 I discussed the question at some length and pointed out the defect in the argument of Prof. Subba Rao who initiated the theory which has subsequently been supported by eminent scholars like Prof. Mirashi and Dr. D.C. Sircar. But my views, though so far ignored, seem to be supported by the present grant, and it is therefore necessary to discuss this question in some detail.      Prof. Subba Rao’s view was based on his interpretation of the date of the Mandasa plates which is expressed as Śakābda navaśataka sapta-rasa-mata. He took it to be ‘clearly’ 913, taking sapta and rasa as equivalent to seven and six, and then adding them. Later, both Dr. D.C. Sircar and Prof. Mirashi took sapta-rasa as equivalent to sattarasa, and read the date as 917. The resulting difference of four years does not materially affect the argument of Subba Rao and need not therefore be discussed here. He argued that, as the Simhipura grant was issued by Dharmakhēḍi in the year 520 of the Gaṅga era, during the reign of Dēvēndravarman, son of Anantavarman, and the same Dharmakhēḍi also issued the Mandasa plates in Śaka 913 (991 A.D.) during the reign of Anantavarman, the initial year of the Gaṅga era would be somewhat, though not much, later than 471 A.D. It is not necessary, for our present purpose, to refer to the further amplification of this theory by which the initial date of the era was fixed as 494 A.D. by Subba Rao, 496 A.D. by J.C. Ghosh and 498 A.D. by Mirashi.      The two main arguments which I advanced against this theory may be stated as follows:      1. There is no warrant for the assumption, so definitely made, that the date of the Mandasa plates is clearly 913 or 917. The words sapta and rasa, which actually occur in the record, undoubtedly mean seven and six, and it is more reasonable to take the date as 976, or 967 if we follow the principle aṅkasya vāmā gatiḥ.      2. There was no king named Anantavarman ruling in the Gaṅga family in Śaka 913 or 917, the assumed date for the Mandasa plates, nor any king called Dēvēndravarman before Śaka 992, whereas we have two kings, father and son, viz. Vajrahasta Anantavarman and Rājarāja Dēvēndravarman, who ruled between Śaka 960 and 999 which would agree with the date Śaka 976 or 967 for Anantavarman suggested by me.      My first argument about the interpretation of the date is now strongly supported by the present grant. As Dēvēndravarman was ruling in Śaka 988, the date Śaka 967 or 976 is a more reasonable assumption than Śaka 913 for his father Anantavarman, particularly as Dharmakhēḍi was alive during the reigns of both.      In order to obviate the difficulties pointed out in my second argument, it has been assumed by the upholders of the present theory about the epoch of the Gaṅga era that all the rules of the Gaṅga family were called, in succession, Anantavarman and Dēvēndravarman. The assumption rests on the fact that for some generations, at a later period, the Gaṅga kings bore the said names in succession. But it is unreasonable to conclude from this that their predecessors were also so named, so long at least as we do not get any satisfactory evidence. Mirashi has argued that the Ponduru grant supplies such an evidence, but, as will be seen later, this is not the case.      All these assumption are demolished by the present grant which gives a clear date, Śaka 988, for Dēvēndravarman. Subba Rao, Mirashi and D.C. Sircar all identified Anantavarman of the Mandasa plates with Vajrahasta Aniyaṅkabhīma (who ruled from Śaka 902 to 937) and his son Dēvēndravarman with one of the three sons of Vajrahasta. But the last of them ceased to rule about Śaka 960 whereas according to the present grant Dēvēndravarman was ruling in Śaka 988.      In order to maintain the present theory of the epoch of the Gaṅga era, D.C. Sircar has suggested that Dēvēndravarman of the present grant was a king of the Śvētaka branch of the Gaṅga family.1 But in view of the close resemblance between the Mandasa and Simhipura plates and the present grant, already pointed out above, it seems to be an absolutely unwarranted view to take the Gaṅga king in these three grants to present two different families. Besides, we should remember that the names of the feudatory rulers, mentioned in the three grants, establish the identity of the family to which they belonged, and it would be very curious if the father and son owed allegiance to two kings bearing the same name but belonging to two different families, particularly as the same phraseology is applied to the suzerain ruler.      We shall discuss presently the question whether Dēvēndravarman of the present grant belonged to the main Gaṅga family or not. But there cannot be the least doubt that the must be identified with Dēvēndravarman, son of Anantavarman, mentioned in the Simhipura grant of Dharmakhēḍi issued in the year 520 of the Gaṅga era. We must therefore presume that the year 520 of the Gaṅga era and Śaka 988 or 1066 A.D. both fell during the reign of Dēvēndravarman, son of Anantavarman. The epoch of the Gaṅga era therefore falls within x years of 1066 minus 520, or 546 A.D., x denoting half the average duration of a reign of, say, about 30 years. The Gaṅga era may therefore be said to have been inaugurated some time between 530 and 560 A.D.      We may now discuss the question whether the Gaṅga kings mentioned in the grants of the Kadamba feudatories, Dharmakhēḍi and Bhīmakhēḍi, belonged to the main Gaṅga family. For this purpose we have to keep in view the following genealogy and dates of the Gaṅga kings which are now generally accepted though there are substantial discrepancies, both as regards the duration of reign and genealogy, even in the different records of the kings of this family. 2                                    Vajrahahasta I (44 years, 895-939 A.D.)|	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|					|					|Guṇḍama I 			Kāmārṇava (35 years,			Vinayāditya (977-80(939-42 A.D.)			942-77 A.D., 25 years			A.D.)				years according to some				inscriptions)|				Vajrahahasta II Aniyaṅkabhīma				(35 years, 980-1015 A.D.)|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|					|					|Kāmārṇava (6 months,	Guṇḍama II (3 years,			Madhukāmārṇava 1016 A.D.)			1016-19 A.D.)			   (19 years, 1019-38 A.D.)	|Vajrahahasta III Anantavarman(according to some accounts, sonof Madhukāmārṇava, 30 or 32years,1038 to 1070 or 1068 A.D.)	|Rājarāja I Dēvēndravarman(8 years, 1068-76 or1070-78 A.D.)	|Anantavarman Chōḍagaṅga(70 years, 1076-1146 or1078-1148 A.D.)	|Kāmārṇava or Madhu-Kāmārṇava(10 years, 1146-56 A.D. or1148-58 A.D.)      As already noted above, king Anantavarman and his son Dēvēndravarman, mentioned in the Mandasa plates and Simhipura grant, were unanimously taken to be kings of the Gaṅga family, and, on the assumption that the Mandasa plates are dated in Śaka 913 or 917, Anantavarman was indentified with Vajrahasta II Aniyaṅkabhīma, and his son Dēvēndravarman with Madhukāmārṇava, though neither of these two Gaṅga kings is known to have born these names. As I took the date of the Mandasa plates to be Śaka 967 or 976, I identified king Anantavarman mentioned in it with Vajrahasta III who was known as Anantavarman and had a son called Dēvēndravarman (Rājarāja).      The present grant was issued in Śaka 988 (1066 A.D.) during the reign of Dēvēndravarman. According to the accepted chronology, Rājarāja Dēvēndravarman, son of Anantavarman Vajrahasta III, ascended the throne in 1068 or 1070 A.D. and it is said in some records that his coronation took place in Śaka 992 (1070 A.D.). This present an obvious difficulty in identifying Dēvēndravarman and his father Anantavarman, mentioned as suzerain in the grants of the Kadamba rulers, with the kings of the same names in the Gaṅga family.      There are, however, several considerations which should be kept in view before we definitely discard the identification.      1. There is the close proximity of dates. The present grant is dated only two or four years before the generally accepted date of Dēvēndravarman’s accession to the throne. It must be very singular indeed, if two sets of kings, bearing identical names and imperial titles, were ruling in the same locality and at the same time.      2. The above argument is further strengthened if we remember that there are some discrepancies in the reign-periods of different kings even in the official records of the family. Such discrepancies are probably due, at least in part, to the well-known fact that the kings of the Gaṅga dynasty adopted Aṅka years for the calculation of their regnal periods, which made a substantial difference between the actual year of the reign and the number given for the same. This might easily prove a source of confusion to later writers who might take the Aṅka for actual years or vice-versa.1 In view of all these a definite date of a king found in his epigraphic record should not be rejected simply because it differs by a few years from the traditional dates so far accepted. When such a difference occurs we should rather reconsider the whole chronological scheme, so far accepted, in the light of the new data. In the meanwhile, it is better to accept the date fixed by the present contemporary record, particularly when it is not in conflict whith the known dates of Vajrahasta III.      3. Like the Chōḷa kings, the Gaṅga rulers also associated their sons in the sovereignty during their own lifetime, and this created a confusion in computing the total reign-periods of different monarchs. As an example it may be pointed out that although Anantavarman Chōḍagaṅga ruled till 1148 A.D., his son Kāmārṇava was anointed in 1142 A.D.       In view of all these it is a reasonable assumption that king Anantavarman and his son Dēvēndravarman, suzerains of Dharmakhēḍi and his son Bhīmakhēḍi, are to be identified with kings Vajrahasta III Anantavarman and his son Rājārājā I Dēvēndravarman. It is to be distinctly understood, however, that whether this identification be accepted or not, it does not affect the epoch of the Gaṅga era, which the present grant places between 530 and 560 A.D., as stated above. On the other hand, if the identification be accepted and Dēvēndravarman’s reign be placed approximately between 1066 and 1076 A.D., we may fix the initial year of the Gaṅga era within narrower limits. As the Gaṅga year 520 fall during the reign of Dēvēndravarman, it must have started some time between 546 and 556 A.D. The exact epoch may perhaps be fixed within these limits by the astronomical data contained in epigraphic records.      It may now be considered how far this theory agrees with the other known data. As regards the Chicacole plates1 of Madhukāmārṇava, dated Gaṅga year 526, I have nothing to add to what has been said in my previous article. The Ponduru grant2 of Vajrahasta, son of Kāmārṇava, dated in the year 500 of the Gaṅga era, has been cited by Mirashi as a definite evidence in favour of the current view of the epoch of the era, and the identification of king Vajrahasta II Aniyaṅkabhīma with Anantavarman of the Mandasa plates. For he thinks that the dates supplied by the Chicacole plates and Ponduru grant establish the following genealogy, with the assumptions shown within brackets.Kāmārṇava (942-977 A.D.)|Vajrahasta II Aniyaṅkabhīma (also called Anantavarman, 980-1015 A.D.|Madhukāmārṇava (also called Dēvēndravarman), 1019-38 A.D.      But on the assumption that the Gaṅga era started about the middle of the sixth century A.D., the data supplied by the same two grants also agree with the following genealogy.Kāmārṇava (1016 A.D.)|Vajrahasta III Anantavarman (1038-70 A.D.)|Rājārājā I Dēvēndravarman (also called Madhukāmārṇava)      Mirashi’s view includes two assumptions as against one of mine.      Reference may next be made to the Kambakaya grant3 issued bu Udayāditya, son of Dharmakhēḍi, during the reign of Dēvēndravarman, in Śaka 1103. As a son of Dharmakhēḍi issued the present grant in Śaka 988 we cannot identify him with the father of Udayāditya. It has been accordingly suggested that the date was probably Śaka 1003. This emendation makes it chronological possible to identify Dēvēndravarman and Dharmakhēḍi with the rulers of the same names in the present grant. But it bring down the reign of Dēvēndravarman to 1081 A.D., while, according to the generally accepted view, he ceased to reign in 1078 A.D. when his son Anantavarman was anointed to the throne. But as the latter ruled for 70 years he must have been anointed at quite an early age and, not unlikely, during the reign of his father. But it is useless to speculate further on a proposed emendation.TEXT1First Plate1 Svastī(sti | ) Amarapurānukārī(ri)ṇa [ḥ*] sarvēbhya2 sā(su)kha-ramaṇī2 yāta(yāt) sudhā-dhavala3 māl-āvīrata-llalīta-llāsyāta4  pa53 paṇḍī(ṇḍi)ta6-sakal-ālaṁkṛita-śrī-Kalī(li)ṁganagar-ādhī(dhi)vā4 sakā[t*] Mahēṁdr-āchal-āmala-kanaka-sī(śi)khara-pratishṭha(shṭhi)tasya sa5 char-āchara-gurō[ḥ*] sakala-bhuvana-nirmāṇ-aika-su(sū)tradhāra[sya*] sa-6 sāṁkaśchuḍāmanīr7-bhagavatō Gōkarṇṇasvāmī(mi)na[ḥ*] chara[ṇa*] ka-7 mala-ju(ya)gala-praṇāmō(mā)d=vī(d=vi)gata-kalī(li)-kala[ṁ*]kō=nāk-āhaya(va)-sa[ṁ*]-8 khō(kshō)bha-janī(ni)ta-jaya-savada8-pratāp-āvanā(na)ta-samasta-sāma[ṁ*]ta-cha-9 kra-chu(chū)ḍāmanī(ṇi)-prabhava9-maṁjarī-puṁja-raṁjī(ji)ta10-nija- nīstrīṁsa11-dhā-10 rōpi12-Kalīṅgādhirāja13-durvāra-vairī(ri)-vāraṇa-ka(ku)[ṁ*] bhastha-Second Plate, First Side11 la-dala-dalī(li)ta-mukutīkā14-prakara-dhvast-ārātī(ti)-kul-āchalō(la)-12 naya-vī(vi)naya-ha(da)yā-dāta(na)-dākhsīnya-saüryō-dhārya15-satya-tyāga-13 prakara-guṇa-saṁpad-ādhāra-bhu(bhū)tō(ta)-paramamāhēsva(śva)ra-paramabhata (ṭṭā)14 raka-mātā-pītrī16-pād-ānudhātā(dhyāta)-paramēsva(śva)ra-Gaṁg-āmala-kula-15 tilaka-śrīma[d*]-Dēvēṁdravarmmadēvasya vī(vi)jaya-rājyē sakāva-16. da na-sata-ash[ṭ]āsītī-samvartu1 Daṁtā(ta)purē sthita2 || tasya mā-17. ṇḍalī(li)ka-paramamāhēsva(śva)ra-Kadamv-ā(mb-ā)mala-kula-kamala-mārttaṇḍa-sama-18 dhigata-pañcha-māhāsavad-ā3 nēka-tu(tū)rya-rav-ō[t*]trāsī(si)tārāti-cha-19 kra-mā(ma)hāmāṇḍalī(li)ka-rāṇaka-śrī-Dharmakhēḍīsya suta4-rāṇaka-20 śrī-Bhīmakhēḍi-pādā[ḥ*] kusalī5 pañcha-pātra6 vīdī(vidi)tam=astu21 bhavatāṁ Bhīlāṁgā-bhōgē  7Māḍagrāma vīyāpāri Prō-Second Plate, Second Side22 [lla]masya suta Viṭhana Reuchiyā nāyakasya suta Pāṇḍava-23 kaṁ duī bhāgaṁ kṛitvā7 mudaka-purvakē8 tāmvra-sāsanīkṛitya9 prada-24 tō-rasmābhī10 || 11na-chaṭa-bhaṭachaṁdrāka(rka) vardhaē12 Viṭhanasya bhāgē Chē-25 ḍisaṁbhuñjatyā13 Sīmā-llīṁ(liṁ) gāni llī(li)khyantē  || Pu(Pū)rva-dīsā14 vō-26 hālā pāthara | Parata pu(pū)rva-dīsā silā15 chhēla abhyaṁtarīkṛi-27 tvā hijala-vṛikshē rōpīta16 silā | Agnī(gni)-dīsā gōraṁgōrā28 kōṇa rōpīta silā | Parata naülīyā taṭākī abh[y*]antarē29 āṁvra vrīksha-talē rōpīta silā  Dakshī(kshi)ṇa-disā vaṭavṛiksha-30 talē rōpīta silā | Parata pāthara pujāṁ | Parata tēṁtalī-31 vrīkha-talē rōpīta silā  Nairītya17 tiṁvuru vrīkha-talēThird Plate32 rōpīta silā || Paśchī(śchi)ma bhumī parvatā sī(śi) khara  ||  Parata durgā33 bhaṭārakī abhyaṁtarīkṛita rōpīta silā || Vāyavya-dīsā khu-34 ḍāpīllō rōmēṁga  ||  Abhyaṁtarīkṛita rōpīta silā  ||  Utra(tta)ra-35 disā vālmīka sanīdhi1 rōpīta silā  ||  Isātē2 kōlātaṭā-36 ka-bhītarē rōpīta silā3  ||37 4sadata paradatāṁ vā  ||  jō harēti vasuṁdharā  ||  saṭiṁ va-38 rīsa sahasrāṇī  ||  vrīshṭhāyaṁ jāyatē kṛima  ||  Mama vaṁ-39 sē na jō jātā  ||  jō bhavaṁtī narādhipā  ||  tēśāṁ pādallagnō40 mī  ||  mama dataṁ na llōpaē  [||*]
No. 19—ASANKHALI PLATES 0F NARASIMHA II, SAKA 1225(5 Plates)D.C. Sircar, Ootacamund      A set of inscribed copper plates was discovered about the beginning of 1919 from the house of a Santal inhabitant of Pargana Asankhali in the Mayurbhanj State, now the District of that name in Orissa. The Santal is said to have found it several years earlier. U.N. Chakladar, a Tahsildar in the Mayurbhanj State Service, submitted the plates to Kamakhya Prasad Basu who was then the Sub-Divisional Officer of Mayurbhanj. The officer tried to decipher the inscription with the help of Nagendra Nath Vasu who was then serving as Honorary Archaeologist to the Mayurbhanj State, and actually prepared a short note on the record, although it was never published. I am grateful for the above information, to Mr. P. Acharya who also supplied me with an extract from the unpublished article by Kamakhya Prasad Basu. The plates are now the property of the Museum at Baripada, chief city of the former Mayurbhanj State and headquarters of the present Mayurbhanj District. In 1941-42, the plates were received for examination at the office of the Government Epigraphist for India, Ootacamund, and several sets of their impressions were prepared by the office mechanic. I am editing the inscription from one set of these impressions.      In the manuscript note on the Asankhali plates by Kamakhya Prasad Basu, the set is described as follow: “Its weight is 15 seers. It has seven plates containing 14 pages, of which the 12 inside pages are inscribed. These seven plates are secured by a stout ring of copper which passes through the perforations of the plates at the top. The plates are each 14" x 9". The copper ring has a lotus attached to it, on which is found a seated bull. There are the mystic symbols of the trident, ḍamaru and half moon on the lotus on both sides of the couchant bull.” The impressions at our disposal show that the record was engraved on six plates. Of these the first and the sixth are inscribed on one side each, while the second, third, fourth and fifth plates have writing on both the sides. There are altogether 212 lines of writing on the plates. Of these the inner sides of the first and sixth plates contain 20 and 17 lines respectively. The first and the second sides of Plate II as well as the second side of Plate IV have 22 lines each, while the first side of Plate IV and the two sides of Plate V contain each 21 lines of inscription. The two sides of the third plate have no less than 23 lines each. Five of the inscribed plates are consecutively numbered. In the margin behind the ring-hole on the inner side of plate I is written gaṁ 1. The second sides of the following four plates have similarly in the margin gaṁ 2, gaṁ 3, gaṁ 4 and gaṁ 5 respectively. The sixth plate, only the inner side of which is inscribed, contains no such number. The letter gaṁ seems to be a contraction of the name of the deity Gaṅgēśvaradēva, the foremost amongst the recipients of the land granted by the charter under discussion. The Kendupatna plates of Narasimha II, dated Śaka 1217, are also similarly numbered; but in their case the numbers are preceded by the letters kuma (only kū in one case) which seem to be a contraction of the official designation of Kumāra-mahāpātra Bhīmadēvaśarman donee of that charter.1      The palaeographic and orthographic peculiarities of the inscription under discussion are the same as those of the other published records2 of Narasiṁha II. They resemble very closely the characteristics of the palaeography and orthography of the Nagarī copper-plate inscription of Anaṅgabhīma III, which have been fully discussed above.1 The consonants p and y are undistinguishable. Similar is the case with superscript n and superscript t, with subscript v and subscript dh, and sometimes with v and n and r and ch. The conjunct ndh is in some cases written like rth (cf. lines 209-10) and rṇṇ is often like rlṇ. The final forms of t and n occur many times in the record. In many cases such half consonants have been used instead of joining them with the following consonants in conjuncts. V and b are indicated by the same sign. In a number of cases, medial ē has been written as in Nāgarī and not in the usual Bengali or Oriya fashion. Of initial vowels, au occurs once in line 198; a, ā, i, u and ē occur in a number of cases. As already noticed, the inscription employs the numerical figures from 1 to 5. It is interesting to note that the figure 2 resembles the shape of an English or Telugu 3, while 3 is written almost like the present Nāgarī and Bengali 2. This is also the case with other medieval Orissan records such as the Kendupatna plates of Narasiṁha II (Śaka 1217), the Puri plates of Bhānu II (Śaka 1234) and the Polsara plates of Arkeśvara (Kaliyugābda 4248).2 The letter ḷ occurs in line 192.      The language of the inscription is Sanskrit. It is written in both prose and verse. The rules of sandhi often remain unobserved even in verses. There are a few cases of sandhi where a sibilant has been preferred to a visarga (cf. surais=saha in line 135). Often the last consonants of the vargas have been changed to anusvāra in sandhi. The reduplication of some consonants after r is found occasionally (cf. both rva and rvva in line 138). Final m has in all cases been changed to anusvāra at the end of the second and fourth feet of verses.      The inscription is dated in the Śaka year 1225 and in the Aṅka year 31 corresponding to the 25th regnal year (omitting, according to rule, the first, sixth, sixteenth, twentieth, twentysixth and thirtieth years) of the Gaṅga king Narasiṁha II (circa Śaka 1200-27, i.e. 1278-1305 A.D.). The actual date was Mēsha (i.e. Vaiśākha)-badi 6 Tuesday. The date is irregular. If the Śaka year is taken as current, Vaiśākha-badi 6 would fall on Wednesday, the 24th April 1302 A.D., but, if it was an expired year, the date would fall on Monday, the 8th April 1303 A.D.      The introductory portion of the charter consists of 105 verses with a number of stray names between verses 6 and 7. This part is also found, with slight variations, in the other records of king Narasiṁha II who issued the charter under discussion. It has been shown that the later monarchs of the Imperial Gaṅga family copied the introductory part of the records of their predecessors and added to it a few verses about their own reigns composed by their court poets. Thus, of the introductory portion of the charters of Narasiṁha II, the ealier part down to verse 79 is also found in the Nagarī plates of Anaṅgabhīma III, great-grandfather of Narasiṁha II. It has been fully discussed above3 and need not be dealt with here. Verse 80 of our record says that king Anaṅgabhīma III died after a reign of 34 years. According to the Aṅka reckoning, adopted by the later rulers of the Imperial Gaṅga dynasty, 34 Aṅka year would correspond to 28 actual years. The king is usually believed to have ascended the throne in Śaka 1133 (1211-12 A.D.) and ended his rule in circa Śaka 1160 (1238-39 A.D.). Verse 81 introduces king Narasiṁha I, son of Anaṅgabhīma III from the queen Kasturādēvī. Verse 84 say that, as a result of the exploits of Narasiṁha I, the waters of the river Gaṅga became as black as that of the Yamunā owing to the collyrium in the eyes of the Javana or Yavana mowen of Rāḍhā and Varendra being washed by their tears and mixed into the waters. This refers to the success of the Gaṅga king against the Muhammadans of Bengal. According to the Tabaqāt-i-Nāsirī4 of Minhāj-uddīn Sirājī. The Rāī of Jājnagar (i.e. the Gaṅga king of Orissa) commenced molesting the Lakhanavatī territory (i.e. the Muslim kingdom of Bengal having its capital at Lakshmaṇāvatī near Gaur in the Malda District) in Hijra 641 (June 21, 1243, to June 9, 1244 A.D.). In the month of Shawāl (March 13 to April 10) of that year Malik Ṭughril Ṭughān Khān, ruler of Bengal, led an expedition against the Jājnagar kingdom and reached Katāsin (on the Mahānadī, lat. 200 32' N, long 840 50' E) within that kingdom. But the Muslim army was completely defeated by the Jājnagar forces and Malik Ṭughril Ṭughān Khān retired from the place without having effected his object and returned to Lakhanavatī. In order to avenge the attack on Katāsin, the Rāī of Jājnagar invaded the Muslim kingdom of Bengal next year and on Tuesday, the 13th of Shawāl, Hijra 642 (March 14, 1245 A.D.) the army of Jājnagar appeared before the gate of Lakhanavatī. The Orissan forces are said to have been led by a general called Sābantar (Sāmantarāya, which was really a title and not a name) who was the son-in-law of the Rāī (king Narasiṁha I). He drove the Musalmān forces as far as the gate of Lakhanavati. The forces of Jājnagar, according to the Muslim author, had, however, soon to return to their own country. The success of Narasiṁha I against of Muhammadans of Bengal is also referred to in Vidyādhara’s Ēkāvatī.1 There is possibly a reference to the performance of the Tulāpurushamahādāna ceremony by Narasiṁha I in verses 85-86. Verse 86 refers to the fact that the king constructed the temple of the Sun-god at Kōnākōṇā (modern Konarak), although the magnificent building is humbly mentioned as a kuṭīraka or hut. According to verse 88, Narasiṁha I ruled for 33 years (i.e. Aṅka years, corresponding to 27 actual years). As Narasiṁha I is believed to have ascended the throne in Śaka 1160 (1238-39 A.D.),2 he may have ended his reign in circa Śaka 1186 (1264-65 A.D.). The next verse says that his successor was his son Bhānu I born of the queen Sītādēvī who was the daughter of the king of Mālava. Queen Sītā’s father must have been a ruler of the Paramāra dynasty of Malwa, although he cannot be identified with any amount of precision. Verse 90 refers to king Bhānu’s 16 Pātras or ministers and verse 94 to the 100 śāsanas (areas of land granted as revenue-free heldings) created by the king. Verse 95 says how Bhānu I died after a rule of 18 Aṅka years (15 actual years). This would place his reign between circa Śaka 1186 and 1200 (1264-78 A.D.). Verse 96 speaks of Jākalladēvī,3 who was the queen of Bhānu I and the mother of the next ruler Narasiṁha II, issuer of the charter under discussion. Verse 97 says how the reigning monarch was the destroyer of enemies and the savior of his family, while verse 99 refers to the 100 śāsanas that he granted at the request of his mother.      The grant was made when king Vīra-Narasiṁhadēva, endowed with a string of titles beginning with ‘the lord of the fourteen worlds’, was staying at the Bhairavapura kaṭaka (city, camp or residence). The passage Gaṅgādēvī-mandir-āntar-vvijay-āvasarē used in his connection suggests that the occasion of the grant was a royal visit to the temple of the goddess Gaṅgā at Bhairavapura. In the passage quoted above, the word vijaya has been used in its Oriya sense of ‘staying’ and vijay-āvasarē means ‘while staying’, ‘at the time of his stay’. The epithet chaturdaśa-bhuvan-ādhipati is really intended for the god Purushōttama-Jagannātha of Purī, whom the Gaṅga kings regarded as their overlord since the dedication of the kingdom in the god’s favour by Anaṅgabhīma III in the first quarter of the thirteenth century.4 By abbreviating an epithet originally meaning a subordinate of the god in the above way, quite familiar to students of Indian history,5 Gaṅga Narasiṁha II seems to have attempted to endow it with an equivocal meaning just as a semi-independent feudatory of a weak imperial ruler often did.6      The mudala, a Telugu word meaning ‘an order’ and here indicating the royal order in regard to the grant itself or its execution,1 passed through the Purō-Pariksha-Pātra Raṅgū Vājapēyin. The word vājapēyin indicates ‘a performer of the Vājapēya sacrifice’, although later the epithet was claimed also by the descendants of a vājapēyin and became stereotyped as a cognoment of the family. It is difficult to determine whether in the present case Raṅgū himself or one of his ancestors was the real performer of the sacrifice. Pātra indicated an officer of the ministerial rank, while Parīksha (same as Parīkshaka) possibly meant an inspector attached to some administrative department. The word purō, prefixed to the official designation, may be the same as Sanskrit pura and the inspector may have been attached to the capital city; but it may also be the same as Sanskrit puras suggesting that the officer in question was the chief of his class. The order of execution of the grant seems to have been given in the presence of three persons, viz. Viśvanātha, Mālā and Vidyādhara. The grant was made on behalf of Hīrādēvī who was a queen of king Narasiṁha II and the mother of the king’s son (cf. taj-jasya sva-kumārasya) Gaṅgarājadēva. This prince having apparently died a premature death, his bereaved parents (king Narasiṁha II and queen Hīrādēvī) were willing to make in his name a grant of 341 vāṭikās of land in favour of gods and Brāhmaṇas so that the merit accruing to the pious act might lead their dead son to heaven (cf. svarga-prāptayē). There were altogether five plots of land which was granted to a deity named Gaṅgēśva radēva and to no less than 104 Brāhmaṇas of various gōtras. The writer of the document, who was the king’s record-keeper (śāsan-ādhikārin), as well as the engraver of the plates also received their perquisites in land.      The first plot of the gift land was an area originally covered with jungle which had, however, been cleared before the grant was made (cf. kṛitt-āraṇya-bhū-bhāga). The area of this piece of land, situated in the Vaṁśōdāchaura vishaya (district), was determined according to the nala (‘measuring rod’ from which in Oriya ‘measurement of area’) of the Purō-Pratihasta Allāladāsa karaṇa. Allāladāsa was a karaṇa or scribe or more probably a Karaṇa by caste as the scribe is usually styled in the records as the śrī-karaṇa. In the designation Purō-pratihasta, the word pratihasta means ‘a representative’. It seems that Allāladāsa-karaṇa was the chief amongst the representatives of the principal officer in charge of the measurement of lands.2 The eastern limit of the above piece of reclaimed forest land touched the west of the Vaṁśōdā road, while its western boundary was marked by a sāla tree. To the south, it touched the northern limit of Vaṁśōdāgrāma and in the north a plot of land belonging to two persons named Vidāi and Ravī. The land within these boundaries measured 54 vāṭikās.      The second plot of land was also a reclaimed forest area similar to the above and situated nearby. It had its eastern boundary touching the west of the Vaṁśōdā road, while the western limit was marked by another sāla tree. In the south, it touched the northern fringe of a piece of land belonging to two persons named Gōvinda-kara and Koṇāi and, in the north, the southern fringe of land of a man named Kitāi or Kitāika. The land within these four boundaries measured 55 vāṭikās.      The third plot of the gift land consisted of a locality called Gaṅgēśvarapura which is described as homestead land. It was also situated in the same region and was bounded on the east by the highway (rājapatha) to the west of the Vaṁśōdā road and on the west by a sāla tree. It is again said that, in the west, it touched a piece of land in the possession of two persons named Gōpāla and Champadāsa, while its eastern limit is said to have been a sāla tree. It will be seen that, in the case of Gaṅgēśvarapura, the eastern and western boundaries are separately and differently mentioned, but that the northern and southern boundaries of the place have been omitted. The enumeration of the boundaries in the other cases would suggest that the reference to the western and eastern boundaries in the second instance actually means respectively the southern and northern limits of Gaṅgēśvarapura which thus seems to have been bounded in the east by the rājapatha near the Vaṁśōdā road, in the west by a sāla tree, in the south by the land of Gōpāla and Champadāsa and in the north by another sāla tree. This piece of land called Gaṅgēśvarapura measured 103 vāṭikās and 8 mānas.      The fourth plot of the gift land touched, in the east, the western limit of the Kumārabhōgya haṭṭa (market-place) lying to the east of the land belonging to two persons named Gaṅganārāyaṇa and Purakōṇāi. The western boundary was market by a sāla tree. In the south, the land reached an aśvattha tree standing at the end of the land of Vidāi-Pānīyagrāhin, while its northern boundary touched a field in the possession of Gopāla and Champadāsa mentioned before in connection with the third plot of land. The expression Pānīya-grāhin (modern pāṇīgrāhī which is a surname among Oriya Brāhmaṇas) means ‘a recipient of water’ literally, but ‘a recipient of a grant’ actually. This is because, according to Indian custom, a ceremonial gift of land, etc., was solemnised by offering water in the lands of the donee.1 When a grant was made to a large number of Brāhmaṇas, the chief amongst the donees seems to have been called Pānīyagrāhin especially. In the present record, though all the donees are referred to as Pāṇi(nīya)grāhin- mahājana, their list is headed by Brāhmaṇa with Pāṇi(nīya)grāhi as his surname. The plot of land in question measured 68 vāṭikās and 4 mānas.      The fifth plot of land comprised the locality called Kumārapura. It was bounded in the east by the highway to the north of Kumārabhōgya (the haṭṭa or market-place of this name mentioned above) and in the west by a sāla tree.  Its southern boundary touched the northern limit of the land of Gōpāla and Champadāsa mentioned before in connection with the third and fourth plots, while its northern end was marked by a hijjala tree. The land within these boundaries measured 66 vāṭikās.      Thus the five plots, measuring respectively (1) 54 vāṭikās, (2) 55 vāṭikās, (3) 103 vāṭikās and 8 mānas, (4) 68 vāṭikās and 4 mānas, and (5) 66 vāṭikās, made a total of 346 vāṭikās and 12 mānas. Out of this area, land measuring 5 vāṭikās, and 12 mānas was substracted for covering gōhari, gōpatha and gō-prachāra. The word go-prachāra means pasture land, while both gōhari and gō-patha indicate broad pathways for cattle. The remaining land measured 341 vāṭikās out of which an area of 100 vāṭikās was granted in favour of the gos Gaṅgēśvaradēva. Whether this deity was installed in the temple of Gaṅgādēvī at Bhairavapura referred to above or at the locality named above as Gaṅgēśvarapura and whether he was names after the dead prince Gaṅgarājadēva cannot be satisfactorily determined. Of the remaining 241 vāṭikās land, an area of 208 vāṭikās was allotted to 104 Brāhmaṇas, each one of them having a share of 2 vāṭikās. The list, however, contains 101 names and 3 names appear to have been omitted inadvertently. That the omission was not detected was possibly due to the fact that often several persons had the same names. To a deity to be installed in a temple in the śāsana (land granted by the charter under discussion) was granted land measuring 4 vāṭikās. Two colleges for Vedic and grammatical studies to be started in the śāsana received respectively 7 and 10 vāṭikās. For making (or covering periodically with thatch) a maṇḍapa (public building), a grant of 3 vāṭikās was made. Another grant of 5 vāṭikās was made for the excavation of a tank in the śāsana. The śāsan-ādhikārin Kāmadēvaśarman who was a Brāhmaṇa belonging to the Pūtimāsha gōtra received 2 vāṭikās. The śāsan-ādhikārin was apparently the head of the king’s record department, who seems to have written the document. Kāmadēvaśarman, as suggested before, probably received the piece of land as his perquisite. He no doubt succeeded Allālanthaśarman, known front the earlier records of the king including the Alalpur inscription edited above, and appears to have been a member of the same family, as both are said to belong to the Pūtimāsha gōtra. Another area of 2 vāṭikās was allotted to the śrīkaraṇa (i.e. scribe) Nāgū-nāyaka, who seems to have engraved the plates or drew the letters on them to facilitate the work of the engraver. Thus altogether 341 vāṭikās of land were granted to gods, Brāhmaṇas and others with the hope that this meritorious act would lead the king’s dead son Gaṅgarājadēva to heaven. The śāsana was styled Gaṅgarājadēvapura after the prince and was made a perpetual rent-free holding endowed with the right to enjoy land and water as well as fish, tortoise and old trees. Seven traders belonging to different markets were attached to the grant as rent-paying subjects. But theirs names are not specified.      A mention of the names of the Brāhmaṇa donees, called pāṇigrāhi-mahājana, as well as their gōtras and titles in necessary as they, along with the other personal names mentioned in the charter and referred to above, throw some interesting light on the social history of medieval Orissa. The expression pāṇi-grāhin is no doubt the Oriya corruption of Sanskrit pānīya-grāhin explained above. The gōtras represented by the donees are Bhāradvāja, Ātrēya, Vatsa, Gautama, Vaśishṭha, Kauṇḍinya, Pārāśara, Śāṇḍilya, Āṅgirasa, Kṛishṇatrēya, Kauśika, Sāṅkhyāyana, Māṇḍavya, Bhārgava and Aupamanyava. With the exception of Brāhmaṇas of the Bhāradvāja gōtra, who are mentioned at the beginning and at the end of the list, the names of the other gōtras are only once mentioned and are followed by the names of the Brāhmaṇas belonging to each one of them. The Brāhmaṇa heading the list of the donees is called Gōpāla-pāṇigrāhī; but the names of the other donees are invariably preceded by a title or surname. The expression put before the names of most of the Brāhmaṇas is Pāṭhin meaning a student of one Vēda, while expressions Paṇḍita and Tripāṭhin (student of three Vēdas) are prefixed to the names of some. One name is preceded by the word Upāsanī and two by Vābhī. The word upāsana, from which upāsanī is derived, generally means ‘worship’ and ‘religious meditation’; but according to the Yājñavalkya-smṛiti, III, 45, it also indicates ‘sacred fire’. Upāsanī in the present case may be the same as Agnihōtrin indicating ‘a Brāhmaṇas maintaining the sacred fire’. Upāsanī is known to be a surname among the Brāhmaṇas of Mahārāshṭra even today. The word vābhī is hard to explain; but, considering the similarity and confusion between the forms of v and n in some cases, one may suggest the reading nābhī possibly indicating the head of community. Beside Gōpāla-pāṇigrāhī, the other donees bore the names: Ananta, Gurudāsa, Sahadēva, Raghudāsa, Kēśavadāsa, Haradāsa (borne by two Brāhmaṇas), Jalēśvara (borne by three Brāhmaṇas), Jagannātha, Ganēśvara, Sashṭhidāsa (borne by two Brāhmaṇas), Kūrmadāsa, Vāsudēva, Vidyādhara, Chāmpadāsa, Gōvinda (borne by two Brāhmaṇas), Chaṇḍidāsa, Sannū, Chitrakara,Lakshmīdhara, (borne by two Brāhmaṇas), Vishṇudāsa (borne by three Brāhmaṇas), Ravī (borne by three Brāhmaṇas), Kīrttinātha, Mitāi (borne by five Brāhmaṇas), Gōvindaratha, Svayambhū, Chōdū, Utsavakara, Ramāi, Brāhmaṇadāsa, Āptī (borne by two Brāhmaṇas), Priyaṅkara, Dāmōdara, Māṇika, Ganū, Vṛiddhī, Nārāyaṇa (borne by two Brāhmaṇas), Kanū (borne by two Brāhmaṇas), Aḷālū, Mantāi, Mādhavakara, Nākū, Viśvapāṇi, Kōṇāi, Bhānukara, Guṇākara (borne by two Brāhmaṇas), Chāṁdū, Harī, Brahmāi, Sīvakara, Ravidāsa, Gauridāsa,Sarvēśvara, Jāgēśvara, Sātū, Ānandī (Ānandī, borne by two Brāhmaṇas), Kachū (borne by three Brāhmaṇas), Kādū, Hṛidayakara, Dēvidāsa, Jāi, Dharmū, Nāgū, Rudrakara, Bhāskara, Champāi (borne by two Brāhmaṇas), Vasundhara, Purushōttama, Vāmadēva, Ratnākara, Kālidāsa, Māṇikadhara, Sṛishṭi, Śaṅkhadhara, Kitāi, Diśanī, Ruāru, Gaṇapati and Kīrttipāṇi. The popularity of names like Mitāi, Kachū, Champāi, etc., is interesting to note.      Of the geographical names mentioned in the production, some have already been discussed above1 in connection with the Nagarī inscription of Anaṅgabhīma III. Rāḍhā and Varēndra, described indirectly as the land of the Javanas (Yavanas or Muhammadans), have to be identified respectively with South-western and Northern Bengal, while, as already noticed, Kōṇākōṇa, where the temple of the Sun-god was built by Narasiṁha I, is modern Konarak in the Puri District. The Bhairavapura kaṭaka cannot be satisfactorily identified. But Vaṁśōdāgrāma, as Kamakhya Prasad Basu rightly suggested, is apparently the present Basta which is a railway station on the South-Eastern Railway in the Balasore District. The Vaṁśōdāchaura vishaya, in which the five plots of the gift land were situated, was no doubt the district round this locality. Basta seems to be a corruption of Vaṁśōdā through the intermediate form Bānsdā. There is a place called Bansda-Sadanandapur near the Basta railway station. The rājapatha near Vaṁśōdāgrāma, mentioned in the inscription, seems to be the old Puri road running half a mile to the west of the present Puri road built in the thirties of the nineteenth century by Rājā Sukhamay Rāy and Rāṇī Śaṅkarī Dēvī of Calcutta. The old Puri road passed via Jalesvar, Khunta, Basta, Rupsa, Ramachandrapur and Rēmuṇā. According to the Bengali works on the life of Chaitanya, the saint reached Rēmuṇā after crossing the Suvarṇarēkhā via Jalesvar and Bansda. Of the intermediate stations mentioned in this connection, Amarda is a village in the Mayurbhanj District (former Mayurbhanj State) and Ramachandrapur is a village near the Haldipara railway station.

No. 24—TWO GRANTS FROM GALAVALLI(3 Plates)D.C. Sircar, Ootacamund      A few years ago two sets of copper-plate grants were dug up from the fields belonging to Mr. B. Rajagopala Rao, President of the Panchayat Board of Galavalli, a village in the Bobbili Taluk of the Srikakulam District, Andhra. The priest of the Kāmēśvarasvāmī temple at Galavalli secured them and sent them to Mr. N. Ramesan, then Revenue Divisional Officer of Parvatipuram. Mr. Ramesan presented the inscriptions to the Andhra Historical Research Society, Rajahmundry, and published both the epigraphs in the said Society’s journal, Vol. XX, pp. 161-70, 171-76. As neither the treatment of the earlier inscription nor its published facsimile appeared to me satisfactory, I was eager to examine the original plates. In January 1956 I visited the office of the Andhra Historical Research Society at Rajahmundry and had an opportunity of examining both the inscriptions through the courtesy of Mr. R. Subba Rao, Secretary of the Society Mr. Subba Rao was also kind enough to allow me to take impressions of the two records.1. – Plates of Gaṅga Year 393      The inscription is written on three plates which measure each 7½" by 2¾". They were strung on a ring which passed through a hole (about ¾" from the left end of the plates and about ¾" in diameter) and the ends of which were soldered beneath a circular seal bearing the usual Eastern Gaṅga emblems of the bull to right, sun, moon, aṅkaśa and chāmara. The weight of the plates, without the ring and seal, is 115 tolas. An interesting fact about the record is that the main document is written on the second (inner) side of the first plate, continued on both sides of the second plate and completed on the first (inner) side of the third plate, while there is a interesting endorsement of a later date which had been begun originally on the second (outer) side of the third plate but was given up and incised afterwards on the first (outer) side of the first plate. In this respect, the epigraph under study closely resembles the Terasingha copper-plate inscription of Tushṭikāra, edited above.1 Only four aksharas of the endorsement had been engraved on the outer side of the third plate before it was given up. The full text of the endorsement as found on the outer side of the first plate covers no less than six lines. The original document, incised on the remaining four faces of the plate, contain 28 lines of writing in the following order: IB—7 lines, IIA—8 lines, IIB—7 lines, IIIA—6 lines.      The characters employed in the main document belong to the class known as the later Kaliṅga script and closely resemble those of records like the Chicacole (Srikakulam) plates2 of Anantavarman who has been assigned to a date about the beginning of the tenth century A.D. The endorsement is written partly in the East Indian variety of the Northern Alphabet and partly in Telugu-Kannaḍa characters. It begins with O instead of the symbol for Siddham usually found in early records. It is well known that the chief characteristic of the later Kaliṅga script is the representation of the same letters in several different forms prevalent in both the Northern and Southern Alphabets. The inscription under study represents almost all the consonants in more than one form. Cf. k in oKaligaṁ (line 2); kh in śikharā (line 2), sakala (line 3), Khaṇḍyama (line 28), g in Kaligaṁnagara (line 2), guṇa (line 10), Gaṁg-āo (line 12), ch in oachal-āo (line 2), char-āchara (line 3), oāchalō (line 9); j in ovijaya (lines 1-2), jaya (line 6), Manujēdraṁ (line 14), vijaya rājya (line 26-27); ṭ in pāṭaka (line 15), trikūṭani (line 18); ḍ in chūḍā (line 4), Baḍavaḍā (line 15; cf.

Sometimes two letters are almost undistinguishable from each other; e.g. ch in ochala (line 2) and y in yaśō (line 7); ch in ochalō (line 9) and v in ovatō (line 4); t and n in janita (line 6) and respectively in śita (line 8) and dākshinya (line 10). In some cases, the same sign of the medial vowel is differently represented; e.g. ū in bhū in bhūyō bhūyō (line 24). There are instances of ṅga represented by gaṁ (cf. lines 2, 26).      The language of the record is Sanskrit. The main document is written in prose except for the usual imprecatory and benedictory stanzas about the end. The endorsement is, however, entirely written in verse. There are really two stanzas in this section; but one of them has been quoted twice. It appears that the engraver of the endorsement began to incise the stanzas in the East Indian alphabet with which he was not quite at case. After completing the first stanzas, he gave up that script and engraved both the stanzas in the Telugu-Kannaḍa alphabet. That is how the first verse of the endorsement was incised twice. As regards orthography, the inscription resembles other epigraphs of the time and area in question. Final n has occasionally been changed wrongly to anusvāra (cf. line 24) which also takes the place of final m at the end of the second and fourth feet of verses. The charter is dated in the Gaṅga year 393 (889-91 A.D.).      The main document begin with the Siddham symbol and the usual praśasti of the Early Eastern Gaṅgas in line 1-11, referring to the issue of the charter from the adhirāsaka (royal residence) at Kaliṅganagara resembling Amarapura (the city of the gods) and to the devotion of the issuer of the grant to the god, Bhagavat Gōkarṇasvāmin (Śiva), installed on the peak of Mount Mahēndra. As usual, the issuer of the charter is described (lines 11-12) as a devout worshipper of the god Mahēśvara (Śiva), as meditating on (or favoured by) the feet of his parents, and as an ornament of the spotless family of the Gaṅgas. He is further introduced in lines 12-14 as the son of Mahārājādhirāja Paramēśvara Paramabhaṭṭāraka śrīmad-Dēvēndravarmadēva. Curiously enough, the passage in line 14, containing the name of the issuer of the grant and the district in which the gift land was situated, reads: omahārāja-Manujēdraṁ(ndra) vagalēla-vishayē. It has to be noticed that while the father is endowed with full imperial titles, the son is represented as a Mahārāja and with śrī instead of śrīmat. Some letters moreover appear to be lost in the passage and its intended reading may have been Manujēṁdrava[rmadēvaḥ kuśalī*] Galēla-vishayē. Wether the intention of the scribe was to include here a passage containing the usual address of the issuer of a grant to the officers and subordinates is impossible to determine. But it appears that Mahārāja Manujēndra or Manujēndravarman issued the charter during the rule of his father, Mahārājādhirāja Paramēśvara Paramabhaṭṭāraka Dēvēndravarman. He may have therefore been a sub-king under his father during the latter’s old age. A similar instance is offered by the passage introducing the issuer of a grant as mahārājādhirāja- paramēśvara-paramabhaṭṭāraka-śrī-Ananatavarmadēva-sa(sū)nu-yuvarāja-śrī-Rājēndravarma(rmā) kuśala(lī) occurring in an Eastern Gaṅga charter1 of the year 313 (809-11 A.D.). Althought a confusion is sometimes noticed in the grants of this family in respect of the use of the titles Mahārāja and Mahārājādhirāja with the name of the issuer and that of his father,1 the above suggestion regarding the relation of Manujēndra with his father seems to be supported by other considerations. In the first place, the date of the record under study, viz. the Gaṅga year 393, suggest the identification of king Dēvēndravarman of our record with the king of the same name who issued the Chidivalasa plates2 in the Gaṅga year 397 (893-95 A.D.), since it is not possible to argue that the latter was a son and grandson respectively of Manujēndra and Dēvēndravarman of the epigraph under study. Secondly, as will be shown below, the endorsement to the main document would suggest that it was a king named Dēvēndravarman who was responsible for the grants recorded in both of them. It is therefore possible to think that Manujēndra made the grant under orders of his father, although some words to this effect are lost in the document.      The object of the record (lines 14 ff.) was the grant of three villages, viz. Nuṁkapāṭaka-grāma and Baḍavaḍā-grāma, both situated in the Galēla-vishaya, and Chintachēḍu-grāma in Hōmva-vishaya. The grant was made in favour Kauṇḍuka-Guṇḍēśvara, probably a deity called Guṇḍēśvara worshipped at a locality called Kuṇḍuka or Kōṇḍuka. The gift was received on behalf of the deity by Sāmavēda-bhagavanta who was the son of Brahmātma-bhagavanta of Vallakōnda (or, Challakōnda) and probably the priest in charge of the temple of Guṇḍēśvara. The boundaries of the gift villages were indicated by a causeway (sētu) and certain trikūṭas3 which are stated to have been wellknown to the people of the district (line 18). Some of the usual imprecatory and benedictory stanzas are quoted in lines 19-26. The date of the charter, viz. year 393 of the increasingly victorious sovereignty of the Gāṅgēya dynasty, is quoted in words in lines 26-27. The document is stated to have been written by Chīḍapa who was the son of Kāyastha Khaṇḍayama called a Rahasya. The expression rahasya indicates the official designation of a Privy Councillor also called Rahasi niyuka, Rāhasika or Rahasyādhikṛita in inscriptions.4      As indicates above, the endorsement engraved on the first side of the first plate consists of two stanzas. The first of these, which has been repeated, says that the illustrious Dēvēndravarman, lord of Kaliṅga, received blessings from the god Śiva and that he granted two localities called Yēgū or Ēgū and Mahanta, collectively known as Giṇṭi was really granted in favour of Guṇḍīśvara, no doubt the same as the deity called Guṇḍēśvara in the original document, and it further states that the grant was made by king Dēvēndravarman ‘afterwards in his presence’ (paśchāt tasya samīpataḥ). The implication is that king Dēvēndravarman ratified the grant in the presence of the deity Guṇḍīśvara at a later date. Yōgātman seems to have been a successor of Sāmavēda-bhagavanta in the office of the priest of the Guṇḍīśvara or Guṇḍēśvara temple. The formation of his name reminds us that of the name of Brahmātma-bhagavanta, father of Sāmavēda-bhagavanta. There is no doubt that the endorsement was engraved at a later date. But whether it was a forgery or a genuine addition to the original record, approved by royal authority, is difficult to determine. Since, however, the palaeography of the endorsement seems to suggest a later date than that of the original grant, the first alternative looks more probable.      The gift villages mentioned in the original document and the endorsement are difficult to identify. We are not sure if the name of the Galēla vishaya is preserved in that of modern Galavalli where the plates were discovered.TEXT1First Plate, First Side1 Õ [||*] Dēvēndravarma Śiva-lavdha(bdha)-sa(śa)rmā śrīmā[n]=Kali[ṁ*]g-ādhipatir= varēṇya-[ḥ |*]2 Yōgātmanē Kōṇḍaguḍāv=adāsīt(t-sa) Yēgu(gū)-Maha-3 ntau khalu Giṇṭi-sa[ṁ*]jñau [|| 1*]2 Dēvēndravarmmā  Si(Śi) valabdha-śarmmā śrī-4 mān=Kali[ṁ*]g-[ā]dhipatir=varēṇya[ḥ |*] Yōgātmanē Kōṇḍaguḍāv-adā-5 sīt(t=sa) Ēgu(gū)-Mahantau kha[lu Gi]ṇṭi-[śa]yijñau3 [| 2*] Dattavān Giṇṭi-nā-6 mānaṁ grāmaṁ Guṇḍīsva(śva)rāya vō(vai |) Dēvēndravarmma-rājēndra[ḥ*] paśchā[t*] tasya samīpataḥ [|| 3*]First Plate, Second Side1 Siddham4 [|*] Svasty-Amarapur-ānukāriṇas=sarvata(rtu)-sukha-ramaṇīyād=vija-2 yavat-Kaligaṁ(ṅga)nagar-ādhivāsakān=Mahēndr-āchal-āmala-śikharā(ra)-3 pratishṭhitasya sa-char-āchara-gurō[ḥ*] sakala-bhuvana-nirmā-4 ṇ-aika-sūtradhāra[sya*] śaśāṅka-chūḍā-maṇēr-bhagavatō Gōkarna(rṇa)sv[ā]-5 minaś=charaṇa-kamala-yugala-praṇāmāt[t*] vigataḥ(ta)-Kali-6 ka[lusha*]-kalaṅkō-nēk-āhava-saṁkshōbha-janita-jaya-sa(śa)bda[ḥ*] pratāp-āva-7 nataḥ(ta)-dig-dēśa-vinirggata-yaśō(śāḥ) samasta-sāmanta-chakra-Second Plate, First Side8 chūḍā-maṇē(ṇi)-prabhā-mañjarī-puñja-rañjita-vara-charaṇa[ḥ*] śi(si)ta-kumu-9 da-kund-ēndā(dv-a) vadāta[ḥ*] dhvast-ārāti-kul-āchalō naya-vinaya-dayā-dā-10 [na]-dākshinya(ṇya)-sau(śau)ry-[au]dārya-satya-tyāg-ādi-guṇa-sam[p]a-11 d-ādhāra-bha(bhū)tō(taḥ) paramamāhēśvarō mātā-pitṛi-pād-ā-12 nudhyātō Gaṁg-āmala-kula-tilaka[ḥ*] mahārājādhirājā-pa-13 ramēśvara-paramabhaṭa(ṭṭā)raka-śrīmad-Dēvēndravarmma-14 dēva-sūnu-mahārāja-śrī-Manujēdraṁ(ndra)va5 Galēla-vishayē15 Nuṁkapāṭakagrāma-Baḍavaḍāgrāma(mau) Hōmva-vishayē ChintachēSecond Plate, Second Side16 ḍugrāma[ṁ cha*] Kauṇḍuka-Guṇḍēśvarāya daṁtta(dattavān |) śrīmad (mad)-Vallakōnda6-Brahmātma-bha-17 gavanta[ḥ*] tasya sūnu[ḥ*] Sāmavēda-bhagavanta[ḥ*] tēna labdhāni (nāṁ) grāma-trayā-18 ṇi(nāṁ) sīmā sētu-trikūṭāni lōka-vishaya1-gamyāni [|*] atra19 Vyāsa-gītāni(gītāḥ ślōkāḥ) bhavanti [|*] Bahubhir=vasudhā dattā rāja-20 bhis=Sagar-ādibhiḥ[|*] yasya yasya yadā bhūmi[s*]=tasya21 tasya tadā phalaṁ(lam ||) Sva-dataṁ(ttāṁ) para-datta(ttā)ṁ  vā  yō  harēta vasuṁdharāṁ-(rām |) sa  vi-22 shṭā(shṭhā)yāṁ kṛimir=bhūtvā pitri(tṛi)bhis=saha pachyatē [||*] Mad-dattaṁ sa[d*]-dvijā-tīnāṁThird Plate, First Side23 pātu(ti) vō(ya) iha daivikaṁ(kam |) matsi(ch-chhi)raṁ(rō)-makuṭa-nyasta[ṁ*] tasya rājñaḥ pada-24 dvayaṁ|(yam ||) Sarvvān=ētāṁ(tān) bhāvinaḥ pārtthivēndrāṁ(drān) bhūyō bhūyō yāchatē  Rā-25 mabhadra[ḥ |*] sāmānyō=yaṁ dharma-sētur=nṛipāṇāṁ kālē kālē pā-26 lanīyō bhavadbhi[ḥ ||*] Gāgēṁ(ṅgē)ya-vaṁśa-pravarddhamāna-vija-27 ya-rājya-samvachha(saṁvatsa)ra-śata-traya(yē) tṛi(tri)-navaty=ādhikaṁ(kē) likhitaṁ28 Kāyastha-rahasya-Khaṇḍyamasya sūnu-Chīḍapa(pēna) iti ||Third Plate, Second Side1 [Õ] Dēvēndra2
No. 24 TWO GRANTS FROM GALAVALLI2.—Grant of Rājarāja I Dēvēndravarman, Śaka 998      The inscription is written on four plates, each measuring 9¼ inches by 4 inches. They were strung together on a ring, the ends of which were soldered beneath the king’s seal bearing the bull emblem and other symbols. The first plate is inscribed only on the inner side while the other three plates have inscription on both the sides. There are altogether fifty two lines of writing, their distribution on the various faces of the plates being as follows: IB—9 lines, IIA—9 lines, IIB—8 lines, IIIA—8 lines, IIIB—8 lines, IVA—8 lines, IVB—2 lines. The four plates together, without the ring and seal, weigh 166 tolas.      The characters belong to the Gauḍīya class and closely resemble those of some of the copper-plate grants of the early members of the Imperial Gaṅga family3 as well as of the later members of the Sōma-vaṁśa of Kōsala and Utkala4 and the Bhauma-Kara dynasty of Tōsalī.5 The sign for v has been used to indicate the letter b. The language is Sanskrit and the epigraph is composed in both prose and verse. As regards orthography also, the inscription closely resembles other records of the area and age in question. Final m has been wrongly changed to anusvāra at the end of the second and fourth feet of verses. In the place of rbbh, rbhbh has been wrongly written in more than one case (cf. lines 5, 20). There are also some other cases of wrong spelling such as siṅgha for siṁha, subha for śubha and saṁśikta for saṁsikta (cf. lines 7, 20, 41-43). Consonants are not only often reduplicated in conjunction with superscript r but in one case also in that of subscript y (cf. omattyaḥ in lines 30-31). The date of the charter is given in the chronogram vasu-nanda-nidhi of the Śaka era, i.e. Śaka 998, while the details of the date quoted are the Vishuva-saṅkrānti in the month of Chaitra, i.e. the day of the vernal equinox. The date of the charter thus appears to be March 23, 1077 A.D.      We know that the later members of the Eastern Gaṅga family began their charters with the praiasti: svasty=Amarapur-ānukāriṇaḥ, etc., in prose as in the charter of the Gaṅga year 393, edited above. The early members of the imperial branch of the family adopted the same praśasti for the introduction of their grants.1 But Vajrahasta III (1038-70 A.D.) introduced a new praśasti beginning with śrīmatām=akhila-bhuvana-vinuta-naya-vinaya, etc., in prose and verse. This eulogy contains no less than twelve stanzas, five in the description of the reigning monarch (Vajrahasta III), one each in that of his father and the latter’s two younger brothers, two in that of his grandfather and one in that of his great-grandfather. The entire praśasti was copied in the charters of his son and successor Rājarāja I Dēvēndravarman (1070-78 A.D.) who issued the grant under study. This king, however, added four new stanzas to the introduction, one referring to the end of his father’s rule and three in his own eulogy. The great Anantavarman Chōḍagaṅga (1078-1147 A.D.), son and successor of Rājarāja I, used the same introduction, as found in his father’s charters, in his earlier grants with the omission of most of the stanzas, although in his later records containing a modified but elaborate account of the early members of the family2 he re-introduced a few of the verses.      The inscription begins with the Siddham symbol and the word svasti followed by a prose passage (lines 1-10) referring to the son of Guṇamahārṇava (Guṇārṇava)-mahārāja (circa 879-96 A.D.) who belonged to the family of the Gaṅga lords of Trikaliṅga. These Gaṅgas are described as belonging to the Ātrēya gōtra and as having obtained, through the grace of lord Gōkarṇasvāmin (Śiva), the unique conch-shell and drum, the ‘five great sounds’, the white umbrella, the golden fly-whisk and the bull emblem or crest. It has to be noticed that the possession of the five mahā-śabdas, explained with reference to North Indian rulers as the enjoyment of five official desginations beginning with the word mahat and in regard to South Indian kings as the privilege of enjoying the sounds of five musical instruments,3 is usually associated with feudatories. Some early medieval South Indian dynasties, however, associated the privilege with imperial dignity and the claim of The Imperial Gaṅgas reminds us of a similar one on behalf of their western neighbours, the Eastern Chālukyas of Vēngī.4      The son of Guṇamahārṇava was Vajrahasta I (circa 896-940 A.D.) who is next described in a stanza (verse 1) saying that he united under his rule the earth (i.e. the Gaṅga kingdom), which had been previously divided into five parts ruled separately by different kings, and reigned for fortyfour years. Then comes a section in prose (lines 13-15) speaking of the three sons of Vajrahasta
No. 26—TWO EASTERN GANGA GRANTS FROM ANDHAVARAM(2 Plates)R. Subrahmanyam, GunturA. Plates of Anantavarmadēva      This set of three copper plates was discovered at Andhavaram1 in the Narasannapeta Taluk of the Śrīkākulam District, Andhra State. Each of the plate measures about 6⅜" by 2⅜". They are fastened together by means of a circular ring (4⅜" in diameter), the two ends of which are secured below an elliptical seal which bears in relief a crude representation of the couchant bull or nandin facing the proper right with a crescent above and a floral design (perhaps a lotus) below. The ring was cut by me for taking impressions. The first and third plates are inscribed on one side only and the second on both the sides. Each side contains eight lines of writing. Though the edges of the plates are not raised into rims, the preservation of the inscription is quite satisfactory.      The script of the inscription bears close resemblance to that employed in the Siddhāntam plates of Dēvēndravarman2 and other records of the early Eastern Gaṅga kings. The engraving is carelessly done. The carelessness of the scribe is responsible for several mistakes of omission and commission. Medial i and ī are not clearly distinguished in many cases. Often p is written likes s (cf. pratio in line 2 and praṇāmāo in line 3) and s like p (cf. sarvvasa in line 9). The letter bh often looks like t (cf. saṁkshōbha in line 6) and t like n (cf. bhagavatō, svāminō=nāvarata in line 3). The consonant after r is doubled in some cases (cf. sarvvartu in line 1). The use of anusvāra for class nasal in saṁkshōbha and v for b in many places is noteworthy. The language is Sanskrit and except for the customary verses quoted at the end (lines 24-30) the inscription is in prose.      The charter records the gift of the village Kālamaḍambiśakuna in the Varāhavartanī vishaya, after making it into an agrahāra and exempting it from all taxes, to the Brāhmaṇa residents of Ānandapura, who belonged to different gōtras and were well-versed in the Vēdāṅgas, by Mahārāja Anantavarman of the Gaṅga family for the merit of his parents. The grant was issued from Kaliṅganagara on the eleventh day of the dark half of Jyēshṭha of the year 216 in the victorious reign of the king. This date of the grant is written both in words and numerical symbols: but there is some disparity between the two. While it is clearly stated in words as śata-dvaya-shōḍaś-ōttarē, numerical symbol 2 in the hundred’s place and 6 in the ten’s place alone are written.3 This appears to be the engraver’s mistake. The grant was drafted at the oral order of the king by Guṇag-ōpādhyāya and engraved by Mātṛichandra.4      The royal praśasti set forth in the record under review does not materially differ from that found in the records of Dēvēndravarman, dated in year 183 and 195.5 One Anantavarman is known from an earlier record6 discovered in the village of Gurandi near Parlakimidi. This record, dated in year 204, mentions Anantavarman as the son of Dēvēndravarman. Though our record does not mention the name of Dēvēndravarman as the father of the donor, since it is dated only twelve years later, and since the Santabommali plates,1 dated in year 221 record a gift of Nandavarman, son of Anantavarman, it is reasonable to identify Anantavarman of our plates with Anantavarman, son of Dēvēndravarman of the above epigraph. If this identification is accepted, Anantavarman of our record should have ruled over Kaliṅga at least upto the 216th year of the Gaṅga era. Calculating from the starting point of the era as fixed by Mr. Somasekhara Sarma, this charter can be said to have been issued on Tuesday, the 6th June, 720 A.D.2      Of the localities mentioned in the inscription, Kālamaḍambiśakuna-grāma appears to be the Sanskritized form of some village name which I am not able to identify. Varāhavartanī-vishaya appears in many early Gaṅga records and has been identified with the region between the rivers Vaṁśadhārā and Nāgāvaḷī, i.e. the modern Srikakulam and Narasannapeta Taluks of the Srikakulam District. Of the other localities mentioned in the record, Dantapura has been cited as the capital of the Gaṅga of Kaliṅga in many of their records3 and it has been identified with Dantavarapukōṭa on the banks of the Vaṁśadhārā in the Narasannapeta Taluk.TEXTFirst Plate1 Ōm5 svasti [|*] Sarvv-artu-sukha-ramaṇīyād=vijayavatāḥ(taḥ) Kaliṅga-na[ga*] rān= Mahēndr-āchal-āmala2 śikhara-pratipṭhi(shṭhi)tasya-char-āchara-gurōh [sa*]kala-su(bhu)vana-ki(nir)rmmāṇ-aika-sūtradhā-3 rasya bhagavatō Gōkarṇṇa-svāminō=nā(na)varata-praṇāmād=apagata-sakala-4 Kali-kalaṅkō nija-nistṛi(striṁ)śa-dhār-ōpārjjita-sakala-Kaliṅg-ādhirā-5 [shya](jyaḥ) prava(vi)tata-chatur-udadhi-taraṅga-mālā-mēkhal-āvanital-āmala-yaśā6 anēk-āhava-saṁkshōbha-janita-jaya-śavda(bdaḥ) pratāp-āvanata-samasta-sāmanta-cha-7 kra-chūḍāmaṇi-prabhā-mañjarī-puñja-rañjī(ñji)ta-charaṇa-kamalaḥ parama-māhēśva-8 rō mātā-pitṛi-pād-ānuddhyātaḥ śrīmad-Gāṅg-āmala-kul-ōdga(dbha)vō mahārājaḥSecond Plate, First Side9 śrīmān=A[na*]ntavarmmā  Vā(Va)rāhavartta[nyā][ṁ*] Kālamaḍamvi(mbi)śakuna-grāmē sarvva-samavētā[n]=kuṭumvi(mbi)nāḥ(naḥ)10 samājñāpayati [|*] viditam=astu bhavatā[ṁ*] yath=āya[ṁ*] grāmaḥ sarvva-kara-bharāt=pra-11 timuchy=ā-chandr-ārkka-pratishṭham=udaka-pūrvva[ṁ*] kṛitvā mātā-pittrōḥ puṇy-ābhivṛiddna-12 yē visa[r*] jana-dāna-nimittaṁ Jya(Jyē)shṭha-mās-āsita-paksh-aikādaśyā[ṁ*] Ānandapu-13 ra-vāstavyai(vya)-nānā-gōttrēbhyō  Va(Vē)dāṅga-pāragēbhyaḥ sarvva(rvvē) bhyō Brā-hmaṇēbhya[ḥ*]14 [syaṁ](saṁ)pradattas=tad=ēvaṁ viditvā yathā(th-ō)cha(chi)ta-bhāga-bhōgamuṁ (m=n)-panayantaḥ [su]kha[ṁ*] pra-15 tivasatē(th=ē)ti [|*] simā-sitahi1 la(li)khyanta(ntē) [|*] grāma-pūrvvēṇa Indrapura-chi(sī)m-ā-16 ntē Sindhi[vā]sē sarvva-pālyāṁ(lyām) [a]śvat[tha]-vṛikshaḥ tatō dakshiṇā(ṇa)-ma(mu)khā va[na*]rāji[ḥ*] I-Second Plate, Second Side17 ndrapura-Dantapura-grāma-tṛi(tri)kūṭē jala-mārggaḥ arddha-chandra iva dakshiṇa(ṇē)-ṇa(na) vakra-[sthi]-18 tas=tatā(tō) vanarāji[ḥ*] paśchimā(ma)-mukhā Dirpikavāṭaśakuna-grā[ma*]-si(sī)m-āntaḥ ku(kū)pā(p-ō)-19 ttara-hala[ḥ*] tatō dakshiṇa-[mukhā*] vakra-vana-rāji[ḥ*] dakshiṇa-pū[r*]vvēṇa gata(tō) nandi-taruh[ḥ]20 tatō(taḥ) pūrvvā(rvva)-mukhā Tivadrāhali2 da[kshi]ṇā(ṇa)-mukhā vana-rāji[ḥ*] punaḥ paśchima-21 mukhā vana-rāji[ḥ*] Ōruvaṅgapāḍā-Śakunagrāma-sīm-āntō(ntē) jala-mārgga-22 sahitā [va*]na-rāji[ḥ*] paśchimāyāṁ diśi Piśāhali-Vukaḍapāṭaka-[Sā]ma-23 ntapāṭaka-Śra (Śa)kunagrāma-tṛi(tri)ku(kū)ṭaḥ tata uttarēṇa vanana3-rāji[ḥ*] pūrdhyāsā-24 [yaṁ]4 yāvad=iti [|*] bhavi[shya]taś=cha rajñaḥ5prajñāpati [|*]6 Āyuryyā(r=yyau)va-Third Plate25 nam=ālōlaṁ lakshmīñ=ch=āpy=ati-chañchalāṁ(lām) [|*] vijñāy=aivaṁ nṛipaiḥ shā(pā)lyō dharmmaḥ sā-26 dhāraṇ-ōdya[ma]7ḥ || [1*] Tathā cha Vyāsa-gītā || Va(Ba)hubhir=vvasudhā data rājabhiḥ Sa-27 gar-ādibhiḥ [|*] yasya yasya yadā bhūmis=tasya tasya tadā da(pha)laṁ(lam) [|| 2*] Sva-dattā[ṁ*] [pa]-28 ra-dattām=vā(ttāṁ vā) yatnād=raksha Yudhishṭhira [|*] mahī[ṁ*] mahīmatāṁ śrēshṭha dānāchchhra(ch=chhrē)yō=na(nu)-29 pālana[m || 3*] Shashṭi-vashsha(rsha)-sahas[r*]āṇi svarggē mōdati bhūmidaḥ [|*] ākshēptā30 ch=ānumantā cha tāny=ēva narakē vasēd=iti(vasēt [|| 4*] iti) pravarddhamāna-vijaya-rājyē sa-31 [mva](saṁva)tsara-śata-dvaya-shōda(ḍa)ś-ōttarē  261 svamukh-ājñayā likhitam=idaṁ śāsa-32 nama(naṁ) Guṇag-ōpādhyāyēn=ōtkīrṇṇañ=cha Mātra(ṭri)chandra-nā[ma](m-ā) kshaśālikēn=ēti mava2 [||*]B. Plates of Vajrahastadēva      These plates were also discovered at Andhavaram. The set consists of three plates of which the first and the last are engraved on one side only, while the second on both the sides. Examination of the plates shows that they had an earlier inscription on them which was completely erased before the present inscription was engraved. But the surface was not smoothened before engraving the later record and this has caused considerable difficulty in deciphering it.3 The edges of the plates have been raised into rima. The plates are of a fairly uniform size measuring 7¾" by 3¾" and about ¼" thick at the edges. The longer sides have a slight inward curve. The plates were strung on a solid copper ring ¾" thick and fairly circular in shape with a diameter of 4". The two ends of this ring are secured under a circular bronze seal, 2¼" in diameter. On this seal are seen the figures of a couchant bull with the crescent on the top, a conch in the rear and a lotus bud with its stalk in a vertical position in front. Below the bull are the figures of an elephant, goad, a small circular disc divided into eight sectors, probably a representation of the sun, and a pūrṇa-ghaṭa. All these figures are cast in high relief. The ring with the seal weighs 94 tolas while the three plates together weigh 186 tolas.      The script of the inscription is old Nāgarī and bears close resemblance to that of the Ponduru plates4 of Vajrahasta and the Chicacole plates5 of Madhukāmārṇava. The language is Sanskrit and the record is all in prose. As regards orthography, the sign of v is used for b (cf. śavda in line 11) and rarely that of ś for s (cf. śīmāo in line 26). The usual imprecatory and benedictory verses are conspicuous by their absence in this record.      The charter was issued from Dantipura. It records the gift of the village of Gōshṭhavāḍa or Gōṭhavāḍa in the Krōshṭukavartanī vishaya by Vajrahasta, son of Kāmārṇṇava, to Maḍapa Bhīmana, son of Dhaṇḍanayāka of Vēmma-kula. The date and the grant are not stated in the record. The charter, however, may be assigned to the 10th century on palaeographic grounds. The inscription contains the usual praśasti of the Eastern Gaṅga family to which the donor belonged. The gift villages was declared out of bounds for the police and military personnel and exempted from all kinds of taxes.      Like the present plates, the Ponduru plates6 also mention one Vajrahasta as the son of Kāmārṇava. According to B.V. Krishnarao7 and others8, the Pondūru plates which belong to Vajrahasta II, are dated in year 500. The donor of the present record may be identified with Vajrahasta II, son of Kāmārṇava I.      The gift village Gōshṭhavāḍa or Gōṭhavāḍa appears to be identical with Gottivāḍa in the Srikakulam Taluk of the Districk of that name. This, however, cannot be verified as its boundaries are not specified.

No. 34—DASGOBA PLATES OF RAJARAJA III, SAKA 112O(3 Plates)D.C. Sircar, Ootacamund, and Sadasiva Ratha Sarma, Puri      The copper-plate inscription published below was recovered from the house of Sri Kshetramohan Das in the village of Dāsgōbā within the Chandanpur Police Station in the Puri District of Orissa.      The set consists of five thick plates held together by a ring with a seal soldered to it. Each of the plates measures about 13¾" X 8½". The ring, which is of considerable thickness, passes through the hole made about the middle of the left margin of each plate. The diameter of the hole in the first, third and fourth plates is 1" while it is 9" in the second and fifth plates. The seal (about 4" in diameter) has the form of an expanded lotus and has in the centre an embossed figure of a seated bull caparisoned and bedecked with ornaments, facing front and having raised neck and head. To the proper right of the bull, there are the emblems of a conch, the crescent moon, a battle-axe, a flywhisk, a ḍamaru and an indefinite object, and to its left are similarly an aṅkuśa and a daṇḍa or gadā. The borders of the plates are slightly raised. The first plate has writing only on the inner side, the others being engraved on both the sides. There are altogether 155 lines of writing in the following order: IB—18, IIA—19, IIB—20, IIIA—19, IIIB—20, IVA—19, IVB—19, VA—19, VB—2. The five plates together weigh 537 tolas while the weight of the ring with the seal is 154 tolas.      The charter was issued by king Rājarāja III (c. 1198-1211 A.D.) of the imperial branch of the Eastern Gaṅga family of Orissa and closely resembles the recently published Nagarī plates1, issued by his son Anaṅgabhīma III in 1230-31 A.D., in respect of palaeography, orthography and style. The date of our grant is Śaka 1120 corresponding to 1198-99 A.D. It was therefore issued about 32 years before the Nagarī plates. Rājarāja III was the son of Anaṅgabhīma II (c. 1190-96 A.D.) and grandson of the great Anantavarman Chōḍagaṅga (1078-1147 A.D.). The importance of the inscription lies in the fact that it is the only copper-plate charter of the king so far discovered. It is specially interesting in view of the fact that as yet we have copper-plate grants of none of the four sons of Anantavarman Chōḍagaṅga, viz. Kāmārṇava III (1147-56 A.D.), Rāghava (c. 1156-70 A.D.), Rājarāja II (c. 1170-90 A.D.), and Anaṅgabhīma II who was the father and predecessor of the issuer of the present charter.      The introductory part of the record contains seventy verses with a string of personal names between verses 6 and 7 in lines 12-16. This part was copied in the Nagarī plates with slight modifications2 and with the omission of only one stanza (verse 63) in the description of Anaṅgabhīma II. The importance of this portion has already been discussed in our article on the Nagarī plates. It has to be noted that verses 37 quotes the correct date of Kāmārṇava’s accession to the throne as nand-artu-vyōma-chandra-paramita-Śaka-samā-vyāpta-kālē dinēśē chāpasthē. This refers to the solar month of Dhanus (Pausha) in the Śaka year 1069 corresponding to 1147A.D. While editing the Nagarī plates, verse 8 was taken to speak of Sarapura as the original name of Kōlāhala, capital of the mythical prince Kōlāhala Anantavarman. But the correct reading of the passage Sarapurañ=cha tadīyam seems to be sa cha purañ=cha tadīyam. This says that both Anantavarman and his capital city became famous under the name Kōlāhala but does not refer to the original name of the city.      The grant portion of the inscription begins in line 122. Lines 122-27 state that, on the occasion of a solar eclipse in the Śaka year 1120, king Rājarāja III, apparently when he was staying at Śrī Purushōttama-kshētra on the shore of the ocean, granted the village of Kōrada or Kōradā in the Aṭṭhāyisa khaṇḍa (sub-division) within the vishaya (district) of Sāyilō in Utkala-dēśa as a rent-free holding in favour of a number of Brāhmaṇas of various gōtras. The grant is stated to have been made for the merit of the king’s mother Vāghalladēvī. It is not impossible that the king and his mother went to Śrī-Purushōttama-kshētra (i.e. Purī) on pilgrimage for taking a bath in holy waters of the Bay of Bengal on the occasion of the eclipse.1 In Śaka 1120 there was only one solar eclipse occurring on Thursday the 28th of January 1199 A.D. The grant, therefore, was made on the said date.      The donees are enumerated in lines 128-45. The names of the Brāhmaṇas are quoted along with their respective gōtra as well as the area of land granted to each of them. Twelve of the Brāhmaṇas received 102 Vāṭīs of land, Vāṭī measuring about 20 acres. Sixty-two other Brāhmaṇas received one Gṛiha-vāṭī or house-site each, while a Brāhmaṇas named Dharmū alone received four Gṛiha-vāṭīs. It is stated that the Gṛiha-vāṭīs granted to these Brāhmaṇas amounted to fifteen Vāṭīs in area. Vidyākarāryya of the Kauśika gōtra was the pānīya-grāhin or the principal donee who seems to have received the ceremonial water from the donor on behalf of the donees.2 He received 20 Vāṭīs out of 30 Vāṭīs of land granted to Viddanāryya. The details of the grant are quoted below in a tabular form. The last name of the list may be that of the God of Purī._________________________________________________________________No. 	Donee 					Gōtra 			Land_________________________________________________________________1	Viddanārya 				Kāśyapa		10 Vāṭīs 2 	Vidyākarārya (Pānīya-grāhin) 	Kauśika		20 do3 	Rudrakarārya 				do			7 do4 	Śivakarārya 				do			7 do5 	Mādhavakarārya 			do			7 do6	Narasiṁhārya 				do			7 do7 	Hariharārya 				do			7 do8 	Kēśavārya 				Hauṇḍinya		10 do9 	Ādityārya 				do			10 do10 	Chandrakarārya 			Kāśyapa		5 do11 	Nārāyaṇārya 				Bhāradvāja		1 Gṛiha-vāṭī12 	Gadādharārya 				do			1 do13 	Nārāyaṇaśarman 			do			1 do14 	Siddhēśvaraśarman 			do			1 do15 	Rāmadēvārya 				do			1 do16 	Gaṇēśvaraśarman 			do			1 do17	Dhanakaraśarman			Bhāradvāja		1 Gṛiha-vāṭī18	Rudraśarman				do			1 do19	Kēśavaśarman				do			1 do20	Jayakaśarman				do			1 do_________________________________________________________________No. 	Donee 					Gōtra 			Land_________________________________________________________________21	Āllōyiśarman				do			1 do22	Payānundaśarman			do			1 do23	Hōtṛi-Mādhavaśarman		do			1 do24	Vāsudēvaśarman			do			1 do25	Buddhaśarman				do			1 do26	Nāgūśarman				do			1 do27	Pītāmbarārya				Parāśara		1 do28	Maduśarman				do			1 do29	Gaṇēśvaraśarman			do			1 do30	Rudraśarman				do			1 do31	Kṛishṇayajvan				Kāśyapa		1 do32	Kāmadēvaśarman			do			1 do33	Vishṇuyajvan				do			1 do34	Budhaśarman				do			1 do35	Gadādharaśarman			do			1 do36	Kāmadēvaśarman			do			1 do37	Chaṇḍōśarman				do			1 do38	Anantaśarman				Rāthītara		1 do39	Padmākarārya				Kauśika		1 do40	Bhōgayajvan				do			1 do41	Gadādharahōtṛi 			do			1 do42	Brahmaśarman			do			1 do43	Vāṅkaśarman				do			1 do44	Gadādharārya				Kṛishṇātrēya		1 do45	Chandrakaraśarman			do			1 do46	Kālōśarman				do			1 do47	Sujjāyiyajvan				Kuddālaka		1 do48	Dēvapālaśarman			do			1 do49	Udgātṛi-Purushōttamaśarman		Vatsa			1 do_________________________________________________________________No. 	Donee 					Gōtra 			Land_________________________________________________________________50	Hariśarman				do			1 do51	Hariharaśarman			do			1 do52	Pajjunaśarman				Vatsa			1 Gṛiha-vāṭī53	Trilōchanārya(?)			do			1 do54	Pūrṇakarārya				Kauṇḍinya		1 do55	Gōvindaśarman			do			1 do56	Mannāyiśarman			Kapi(?)		1 do57	Kēśavaśarman				do			1 do58	Tantōyajvan				Kṛishṇātrēya		1 do59	Kēśavaśarman				do			1 do60	Jagēśvar-āhitāgni			do			1 do61	Pannāyiśarman			do			1 do62	Sujāyiśarman				do			1 do63	Purushōttamārya 			do			1 do64	Dāmōdaraśarman			do			1 do65	Rāmadēvaśarman			do			1 do66	Padmanābhārya			Gārgya			1 do67	Kṛishṇāśarman			Vatsa			1 do68	Kituśarman				Ghṛitakauśika		1 do69	Ālōiśarman				Kāśyapa		1 do70	Dāmōdaraśarman			do			1 do71	Dhṛitikaraśarman			Vārshagaṇa		1 Vāṭī72	Viyudēvārya				Vatsa			2 do73	Kēśavārya				Ālaṁvāyana		10 do74	Dharmū				…..			4 Gṛiha-vāṭīs75	Śrī-Purushōttamadēva			…..			1 do_________________________________________________________________      The concluding part (lines 146 ff.) of the inscription contains the usual imprecatory and benedictory stanzas, many of which are found in the Nagarī plates and other inscriptions of the family. Verse 77 praying for the everlasting fame and prowess of king Rājarāja III is an interesting new stanza. Verse 78, also found in the Nagarī plates, states that the praśasti was composed by Appa(yya?)na. This poet therefore adorned the court both of Rājarāja III and his son Anaṅgabhīma III. Line 154 speaks of the artisan Lōkāyi who engraved the record. The inscription ends with a reference to Kēśavārya of the Ālaṁvāyana gōtra receiving 10 Vāṭīs of land. The name of this donee was apparently omitted from its proper place through oversight.      As to the geographical names in the grant portion of the record, Sāyilō-vishaya in Utkaladēśa is the present Sailo Pargana in the Cuttack Districk of Orissa. Aṭṭhāyisa-khaṇḍa (literally, ‘the subdivision of 28 [villages]’), in which the gift village of Kōrada or Kōradā was situated, seems to have formed a part of the Pargana in question. There is a Pargana called Aṭhāisī comprising the Konarak region of the Puri District. The inclusion of this in the old Sāyilō-vishaya would suggest that the latter extended from the Kathjuri river to the sea. Mr.P. Acharya is inclined to associate Aṭṭhāyisa-khaṇḍa with modern Aṭṭhāspur in sheet map No. 73/L/4.TEXT1      [Metres: Verses 1-3, 5-6, 9-11, 15, 20, 24-31, 33, 40-41, 48, 50, 54, 56-58, 60-61, 65, 68

No. 40—PEDDABAMMIDI PLATES OF VAJRAHASTA III, SAKA 982(2 Plates)R.C. Majumdar, Nagpur      This set of four copper plates was found at Peddabammiḍi in the Narasannapet Taluk of the Srikakulam District, Andhra. They were forwarded by Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Guntur, to the Government Epigraphist for India. I edit he grant from a set of excellent estampages kindly supplied by the latter. The plates are now in the possession of the Andhra University, Waltair.      Each of the plates is 8" long and slightly less wide in the middle (3") than at ends (3o2"). They are held by a circular ring with a diameter of 3o5". The seal soldered to the ring has on its surface the emblems of a bull, a conch, the moon, a goad, a fly-whisk, a flag and a tortoise. The plates and the ring with the seal weigh respectively 94 and 54 tolas. The outer side of the first plate has no writing. The inner side of the first plate and both sides of the second and third plates have eight lines of writing each. The fourth plate has seven lines of writing on the first side. The second side of this plate has traces of writing: but, though individual letters can be read here and there, no sense of this part can be made out; hence no attempt has been made to read it.1 There are thus altogether 17 lines of legible writing which are in a good state of preservation.      The alphabet belongs to the same type of the Gauḍīya script as is used in the Nadagam,2 Madras Museum3 and Narasapatam4 plates and many other Eastern Gaṅga grants.5 Interesting are the forms of ñch and ñchh. The sign for v has been used to indicate b.       The language is Sanskrit and the legible portion of the inscription is written in prose with the same twelve verses in the introductory portion, which are found in several other copper-plate grants of the king who issued the charter. As a matter of fact, the whole of the introduction (lines 1-41) is a verbatim reproduction of that in the Nadagam and Madras Museum plates and varies very slightly from that in the Narasapatam plates.      With regard to orthography, we may note that the class nasal is used instead of anusvāra, although there are a few exceptions. Many of the consonants are doubled after r. T is sometimes doubled before r; but usually we have the form tra. There are many mistakes in the text of the document. Often one letter is put for another and the vowel signs are omitted or wrongly put. Sometimes letters and even words are omitted while the visarga sign is frequently omitted.      The grant was issued from a place, the name of which begins with ka and ends in nagara. The second letter is doubtful, and there is no room for a third letter before nagara. The name may be a mistake for Kaliṅganagara.      The grant was issued by Paramabhaṭṭāraka. Mahārājādhirāja Vajrahasta (III), the overlord of the three Kaliṅgas and a devout worshipper of Mahēśvara, and records the grant of the village of Santarama (line 42) in favour of Palayya, son of Dādōrēvāna and his wife Dalēmavā (line 45-46). The village was situated in the district (vishaya) of Kōluvarttani, a name which also occurs in the Nadagam plates (line 57). The epitet sva-paurusha-paritōshita, applied to the donee, perhaps alludes to some deeds of valour performed by him, and the grant may be a reward for that. The illegible portion presumably contained the boundaries of the land granted together with the imprecatory verses.1      The grant was made in the Śaka year 982 (line 44) on Thursday the fifth of the bright fortnight in the month of Makara. The date regularly corresponds to the 28th December, 1060 A.D.2 The donee is said to belong to the Vēsyā family (line 45). Vēsyā may be taken as an error for vēśyā (prostitute), for the interchange of ś with s frequently occurs in this record. But it is hardly likely that a man’s ancestry should be traced to a prostitute in a public document. So it may be suggested that the word stands for Vaiśya.3TEXT4[Metres: verses 2, 6, 12 Anushṭubh; verses 7, 8 Gīti; verses 5, 9 Mālinī; verses 1, 3, 11 Śārdūiavikrīḍita; verse 4 Vaṁśastha; verse 10 Vasantatilakā]First Plate1 Õṁ5 svasti [ | ] [śrī]matām=akh[i]la-bhuvana-vinuta-naya-vinaya-dayā-dāna-dākshiṇya-satya-śaucha-2 śauryya-dhairyy-ādi-guṇa-ratna-pavitrak[ā*]ṇām=Ātrē[ya*]-gōtrāṇāṁ vimala-visā(chā)r-āsā(chā)ra-puṇya-śa(sa)-3 lila-pra[kshā]lita-Kali-kāla-kalma[shā(sha) ]-mashīṇāṁ mahā-Mahēndr-āchala-śikhara-prati-4 shṭhitasya sa-char-āchara-gūrōḥ  sakala-bhuvana-nirmmāṇ-aika-sūtradhāra-5 sya śaśāṅka-chūḍāmaṇērbhbha(r=bbha)gavatō Gōkarṇṇasvāminaḥ prasādā[t*]6 samāsādit-aikaśansa(ṅkha)bhērī-pañchamahāśavda(bda)-dhavalachchhattra-hēmachā-7 mara-varavṛishabhalāñchhana-samujva(jjva)la-samasta-sāmrājya-mahimnām=anē-8 ka-samara-saṅghaṭṭa-samupalavdha(bdha)-vijaya-lakshmī-samāliṅgit-ōtaṁ(ttuṁ)ga-bhu-Second Plate, First Side9 ja-daṇḍa-maṇḍitānāṁ Trikaliṅga-mahībhujāṁ Gaṅgānām=anvayam=alaṅka-10 rishṇō[ḥ*] Vishṇōr=iva vikram-ākrānta-dharā-maṇḍalasya Guṇamahārṇṇava-maha(hā)-11 rājasya putraḥ || 0 || Pūrvvaṁ bhūpatibhir=vvibhajya vasudhā yā pañchabhiḥ pa-12 ñchadhā bhuktā bhūri-parākramō bhuja-va(ba)lāt=tām=ēka  ēva svayaṁ(yam | ) ē-13 kīkṛitya vijitya sa(śa)ttru-nivahān śrī-Vajrahastaś=chatuśchatvāri-14 ṁśa[ta*]m=aty-udāra-charitaḥ sarvvām=arakshīt=samāḥ ||[1*] Tasya tanayō Guṇḍama-ra(rā)-15 jā(jō) [ha(va)][r*]sha-trayam=apālayata mahīṁ(hīm) || tad-anujaḥ Kāmārṇnavadēvaḥ pañcha-16 triṁśatam=avda(bda)kān || tasy=ānujō Vinayāditya[ḥ*] samās=tisra[ḥ*] || tataḥ Kā-Second Plate, Second Side17 mārṇṇavāj=jātō jagatī-Kalpabhūruhaḥ || yō=rājad=rājitaḥ(ta)-chchhāyō Va-18 jrahastō=vani1-patiḥ [||2*] praśchyōda(ta)n-mada-gandha-luvdha(bdha)-madhupa-vyālīḍha-gaṇḍā-19 n=gajān=artthibhyas=samadāt=sahasram=atulō yas=tyāginām=agraṇī[ḥ |*] saḥ(sa) śrīmā-20 n=Aniyaṅkabhi(bhī)ma-nṛipatir=Ggaṅg-ānvay-ōttaṁsakaḥ pañchatriṁśatam=a-21 vda(bda)kān=samabhunakpri(k=pṛi)thvīṁ stutaḥ pārthivaiḥ || [3*] Tad-agra-sūnuḥ Surarāja-22 sūnunā | samaḥ] samastāṁ sa(śa)ma(mi)t-āri-maṇḍalaḥ [|*] sma pāti Kāmārṇṇava-bhūpatir=bhuvaṁ sa-23 mṛiddhima(mā)n=ardha-samāṁ samujva(jjva)laḥ || [4*] Tad-anu tad-anujanmā Chi-ttajanm-ōpama(mā)-24 nō guṇa-nidhir=aṇa(na)vadyā(dyō) Guṇḍam-ākhyō mahīsa(śa)ḥ [|*] sakalam-idam-ara-Third Plate, First Side25 kshat=trīṇi varshāṇi dhātrī-valayam=alaghu-jē(tē)jō-nirjjit-ārati-chakraḥ || [5*] Tatō26 dvē(dvai)māturas=tata(sya) Madhukā[mā*]rṇṇavō nṛipaḥ [|*] ā(a)vati sm=āvanīm= ētām=avdā(bdā) mē(n=ē)-27 kāṇṇa(n-na)-viṁśatiṁ(tim) ||0|| [6*] Atha Vajrahasta-nṛipatēr-agra-sutād=akhila-guṇi-jan-āgra-28 [ga*]ṇya | ḥ  [*] Kāmārṇṇavā[t*] kavē(vī)ndra-pragīyamān-āvadāta-śubha-kīrttiḥ || [7*] Śriya iva Vaidumva(mb-ā)-29 nvaya-payaḥ-payōnidhi-samudbhavāyāś=cha [ |*] yaḥ samajani Vinaya-mahādē-30 vyāḥ śrī-Vajrahasta iti tanā(na)yaḥ || [8*] Viyad-ṛitu-nidhi-saṁkhyāṁ yāti Śāk-āvda(bda)-sa-31 ṅghē dinakṛiti Vṛishaba-sthē  tē2 Rōhiṇī-bhē su-lagnē [ |*] Dhanusi cha sita-pakshē Sūryya-32 vārē tṛitīyaṁ(yā)-yuji sakala-dharitri(trī)ṁ rakshituṁ yō=bhishiktaḥ || [9*] Nyāyē(yyē)naThird Plate, Second Side33 yatra samam=ācharituṁ tri-vārgga(varggaṁ) ma(mā)rggēṇa rakshati mahīṁ mahita-pratāpē [ |*] nirvvyā34 dhayaś=cha3 nirāpadaś=cha śachachha-prajā4 bhuvi bhavanti vibhu (bhū)timattyaḥ || [10*] Vyāpē Ga-35 ṅga-kul-ōttamasya yasa(śa)śā(sā) dik-cha[kra*]va(vā)la(lē) sachi(śi)-pradyōta(t-ā) malinēna yasyā(sya) bhuvaniḥ(na)-prahlā36 da-sampādinā [ |*] se(sai)ndūrair=ati-sāndra-paṅka-paṭalē(laiḥ) kumbha-sthalī-paṭṭakēśā-(shv=ā)limpanti37 punaḥ punaś=cha haritām=ādhu(dhō)raṇā vāraṇān || [11*] Ā(A)nura(rā)gēṇē(ṇa) guṇinō yasya38 vakshō-mukh-āvja(bja)yōḥ [ |*] āśī(sī)nē  Śrī-Sarasvatyāv=anukūlē virājata[ḥ*]  ||0|| [12*] Ka[si]-39 nagarā1 paramamāhēsva(śva)ra-paramabhaṭṭāraka-mahārājādhirāja-Trikaliṅgādhi-40 pati-śrimadva Vajra2hastadēva[ḥ*] kuśalī samast-āmātya-pramukha-jana-Fourth Plate, First Side41 padān=sam[āhū]ya samājñāpayati viditam-astu bhavā(va)tāṁ Kōluvarttani-vi-42 shayë Santaram-ākhya-grāmaś=chatuḥ-sīm-āvachchhinnas=sa-jala-sthala [ḥ*] [sa*]-[rvva]-pī43 ḍā-vivarjjitam=ā-chandr-ārkha-ksha(kshi)ti-sama-kālaṁ yāvan=mātā-pitrōr= ātmanaḥ44 puṇya-yaśō-bhivṛiddhayē  kara-vasu-nidhi-Śākāvdē(bdē)  Makara-māsa-śu45 kla-paksha-paṁchamyāṁ  Guru-vārē || Vēsyā(Vaiśya)-vaṁś-ōdbhavaḥ |3 Dādōrēvā46 nas=tasya bhāryyā Dalēmavā | tayōḥ putrāya Pallayāya chira-kālam=ārā-47 dhya sva-paurusha-paritōshitāya data iti ||4 
No. 43—KALAHANDI PLATES OF ANANTAVARMAN VAJRAHASTA,GANGA YEAR 383(1 Plate)P. Banerjee, New Delhi      This set of three copper plates belongs to the Maharaja of Kalahandi in Orissa. The plates were published by Mr. Satyanarayana Rajaguru in the Journal of the Bihar Research Society, Vol. XXXV, pp. 10-27. According to Mr. Rajaguru, they were originally found in a village called Chīpurupalli about sixteen miles to the east of Parlakimedi in the Ganjam District, Orissa. The plates were received for examination by the Government Epigraphist for India from the Maharaja of Kalahandi in 1952-53. I edit them from a nice set of inked impressions kindly supplied to me by the Government Epigraphist for India.      The plates measure 7½" X 2⅝" each. They were strung originally on a ring with a seal; but the ring had already been cut open before the inscription reached the Government Epigraphist for India. The seal attached thereto is very much obliterated. Of the three plates, the first and third are written on their inner side only, while the second contains writing on both the sides. There are altogether 24 lines of writing in the inscription. The last line contains only three aksharas.      The characters belong to the Kaliṅga alphabet of about the 9th century A.D. and resemble those of the Alamanda plates1 of Anantavarman (Gaṅga year 304). Indian Museum2 plates of Dēvēndravarman (Gaṅga year 308), Chicacole3 plates of Satyavarman (Gaṅga year 351), Tekkali plates4 of Anantavarman (Gaṅga year 358), etc. Some of the letters show varying forms; cf. k in okāriṇaḥ in line 1, sakalao in line 3, and kamalao in line 4; m in Amarao in line 1, Mahēndrāo in line 2, Bhūpēndravarmmao and Anantavarmmao in line 11, vālmikao in line 17, and Mahāragrāma in line 23; r in gurō in line 3, vara and charaṇa in line 7 and taruḥ in line 16, etc. The script is a curious admixture of northern and southern forms. The letters b and r are denoted throughout by the same sign. The language of the inscription is corrupt Sanskrit. The whole of it has been composed in prose. As regards orthography, the anusvāra and visarga have very frequently been omitted. There are mistakes such as the use of i in the place of ī, of ri in the place of ri, of ś in the place of sh, etc.      The object of the inscription is to record a grant of some land to a Brāhmaṇa called Nārāyaṇa Jaḍyālākshētra, son of Nārāyaṇa probably belonging to the village of Mahāvagrāma.5 The donor was Anantavarman Vajrahasta, son of Bhūpēndravarman of the Eastern Gaṅga dynasty. The charter is dated in the year 383 of the augmenting and victorious reign of the Gaṅga dynasty. There is a good deal of controversy regarding the initial year of the Gaṅga era. But several scholars now hold that the Gaṅga era started sometime between 494 and 498 A.D. If this view is accepted, the date of the present inscription would fall in the period 877-81 A.D.      No other inscription of Anantavarman Vajrahasta, the donor of the present grant, has come to light as yet, nor is his name mentioned in any other grants known so far. Regarding his ancestry nothing more is known from the present record beyond that he was a son of Bhūpēndravarman. Fortunately, however, the name of Bhūpēndravarman is found in a few other inscriptions, e.g., the Chidivalasa plates1 and Nāpitavāṭaka grant.2 The first of these records id dated in the Gaṅga year 397 and the second, though undated, has been assigned to the same age.3 These two grants were issued by Dēvēndravarman, son of Bhūpēndravarman who is apparently identical with his namesake of the present record. The identification is supported by the dates of the records as well as the close similarity in the phraseology of their introductory portions. Thus Bhūpēndravarman appears to have had two sons, viz. Anantavarman Vajrahasta and Dēvēndravarman. The latter, as the date of the Chidivalasa plates would show, was the younger brother and successor of Anantavarman Vajrahasta of the present charter.      From Chidivalasa plates we learn that Bhūpēndravarman was called also Mārasiṁha and his father’s name was Vajrin. In the opinion of Mr. Somasekhara Sarma, Bhūpēndravarman was identical with Rājēndravarman of the Mandasa plates4 of the Gaṅga year 342 as the names Rājēndra and Bhūpēndra are synonymous. Mr. Sarma identifies Vajrin with Vajrahasta of the Parlakimedi plates.5 He further observes that this Vajrahasta was none other than Anantavarman of the Alamanda plates of the Gaṅga year 304 as the style and phraseology of these inscriptions would tend to show.6 Mr. Sarma proposes the following geneology:Rājēndravarman|-----------------------------------------------------------------------		|								|Anantavarman (Alamanda plats, Gaṅga		Dēvēndravarman (Indian Museumyear 304) alias Vajrahasta or Vajrin			plates,7 Gaṅga year 308; Tekkali8                       |						plates, Gaṅga year 310)                       |									|Rājēndravarman9 (Gaṅga year 314;			Satyavarman (Chicacole plates,10 Mandasa plates, Gaṅga year 342) alias		Gaṅga year 351)Bhūpēndravarman								|                     |									|                    ----------------------------------					--------------                                                                |						       |                     ----------------------------------------------------------------			       |                     |				|		      		 |		       |Anantavarman Vajrahasta (the present		Dēvēndravarman (Chidivalasa      |record of Gaṅga year 383)				plates, Gaṅga year 397; 	       |							Nāpitavāṭaka grant); may be the    |							same as his namesake of the 	       |							Nirakarpur plates discussed 	       |							below				       |						--------------------------------------------------						|				Anantavarman (Tekkali plates,11					Gaṅga year 358).      In the absence of any definite proof, the suggestion of Mr. Sarma can only be regarded as tentative. Though Bhūpēndra and Rājēndra are synonymous, it cannot be held as certain on that ground that they were one and the same person. As noted above, the Chidivalasa plates mention Mārasiṁha as the second name of Bhūpēndravarman. But nowhere in the inscriptions discovered so far he has been called Rājēndra. Again, though it is quite possible that Vajrin was identical with Vajrahasta of the Parlakimedi plates as suggested by Mr. Sarma, it is difficult to agree with his suggestion that he is identical also with Anantavarman of the Alamanda plates. It is equally plausible that Vajrin or Vajrahasta and his son Bhūpēndravarman reigned somewhere between the date of Anantavarman of the Tekkali plates of the Gaṅga year 358 and that of Anantavarman Vajrahasta of the present record of the Gaṅga year 383. This will not go against the question of phraseological affinities between the Parlakimedi plates of Vajrahasta and those of the Tekkali plates of Anantavarman (Gaṅga year 358) or of the present grant. Nothing definite, however, can be said until further evidence comes to our aid. It may be noted that the Nirakarpur plates1 mention one Dēvēndravarman and his father Bhūpēndravarman. The praśasti portion of the inscription shows similarity to that of the present record as well as of the Chidivalasa plates mentioned above. This would suggest that they were identical with their namesakes of the Chidivalasa plates and the Nāpitavāṭaka grant.      The donor of the Nirakarpur plats was Udayakhēḍī, son of Ugrakhēḍī and grandson of Dharmakhēḍī of the Kadamba family of Kaliṅga, which owed allegiance to the Gaṅga rulers. Besides the Nirakarpur plates, the Kadambas are mentioned also in several other inscriptions. The Parlakimedi plates2 of Vajrahasta mention one Ugrakhēḍī who is described as the ornament of the Kadamba dynasty and as born in the family of Nidusanti. This Ugrakhēḍī was the governor of an area including a village called Hōssaṇḍi3 which was given to one Rājaputra śrī-Kāmadi4 by Dāraparāja, son of Chōla Kāmadirāja, in the reign of king Vajrahasta of Kaliṅga. The Parlakimedi plates are not dated. But, as shown above, the Gaṅga king Vajrahasta mentioned therein was perhaps identical with Vajrin, father of Bhūpēndravarman and grandfather of Anantavarman Vajrahasta and his brother Dēvēndravarman. If this is accepted, Ugrakhēḍī of the Parlakimedi plates was probably identical with the Kadamba chief of the same name mentioned in the Nirakarpur plates5 of Dēvēndravarman. Again, the Nirakarpur plates show that Udayakhēḍī, son of Ugrakhēḍī and grandson of Dharmakhēḍī, was a contemporary perhaps of Bhūpēndravarman, his son Anantavarman Vajrahasta (of the present grant) and the latter’s brother Dēvēndravarman.6      The writer of the charter was Sarvadēva. The name of one Sarvadēva occurs as the engraver of the Chicacole plates1 of Dēvēndravarman (Gaṅga year 251) also. Mr. Rajaguru thinks that the date of the Chicacole plates should be construed as 351 and the two Sarvadēvas are to be treated as one and the same person.2 But there is a difficulty in accepting this suggestion. We know that Satyavarman, son of Dēvēndravarman of the Indian Museum and Tekkali plates dated respectively in the Gaṅga year 308 and 310, issued his charter in the Gaṅga year 351. Thus it is difficult to place Dēvēndravarman of the Chicacole plates in the year when Satyavarman was ruling.      The names of the localities mentioned in the inscription cannot be identified. It is interesting to note that to the names of the donee and his father are also attached the names of the localities to which they belonged. These names are given as Nārāyaṇa Jaḍyālākshētra and Mahāva-grāma-gōtra Nārāyaṇa.3 Jaḍyālā as the name of a village is mentioned in the text of the present inscription (line 13). The practice of afiixing the name of a village or locality to its resident is even now prevalent in different parts of India and outside.TEXT4First Plate1 Õṁ5 Svasty=Amarapur-ānukāriṇa[ḥ*] sarv-atya(rtu)-sukha-ramaṇi(ṇī)ya(yā)d=vijaya-2 vata[ḥ*] Kaliṅgā(ṅga)nagar-ā[dhi*]vāsaka(kāt) Mahēndr-āchal-āmala-si(śi)khara-prati-3 shṭi(shṭhi)tasya sa-[char-ā*]chara-gurō[ḥ*] sakala-bhuvana-nirmāṇ-aika-sūtradhārasya4 śaśāṅka-chu(chū)ḍāmaṇi(ṇē)r=bhagavatō Gōkarṇasva(svā)minaś-charaṇa-kamala-yugala-pra-5 ṇāmād=vigata-kali-kalaṅkō=nēk-āhava-saṁkshōbha-jā(ja)nita-jaya-śavda(bdaḥ)Second Plate, First Side6 pratāp-āvanata-samasta-sāmanta-chakra-chūḍā-maṇi-prabhā-mañjari-7 puñja-rañjita-vara-charaṇa[ḥ*] sita-kumuda-kund-ē[n*]dvā(dv-a)vadāta-diśdēg(g-dē) śa-vini-8 rgata-yaśasa6 paramamāhēśvarō mātā-pitri-pād-ānyu(nu)dhyātō dhvasta(st-ā)-9 rāti-kul-āchalō naya-vinaya-dayā-dāna-dākshinyaḥ(ṇya)-śau[r*]y-audāryya-10 satya-tyāg-āddhi(di)-guṇa-sampad-ādhāra-bhūtō Gaṅg-āmā(ma)la-kula-Second Plate, Second Side11 tilaka-śrī-mȧ(ma)ha(hā)rāja-Bhūpēndravarmma1-sūnunā  śrī2-Anantavarmmadēva-mā(ma)-12 hārājādhirāja-śrī-Vajrahastadēvēnaḥ(na)3 idāni(nīṁ) sīmā-liṅgāni likhyantē [|*]13 I(Ai)śānyā[ṁ*] diśi sa[ṁ*]rōpita-pāshāṇaḥ Jaḍyālā-Vōṅkhar-ōbhaya-grāma-saṁmi-14 lita-sīmāyāṁ tataḥ Pūrvvasyāṁ diśi halaṁdū-vṛikshaḥ(ksha)s=tata(tō) bhātakī-vṛikshas=ta-15 smād=anantaraṁ dhanaṁjaya-vṛikshas=tata[ḥ]  tintṛi(ntri)ṇikā [|*] A(Ā)gnēymā (yyāṁ) diśi sa[ṁ*]rōpita-śilā [|*]16 Dakshiṇasyā[ṁ] diśi nānā-vṛiksh-ākulita-śārttā gartt=ātaḥ4 tintṛi(ntri)ṇika(kā)-taruḥ tasmād=a-Third Plate17 py=anantaraṁ vā(va)lmi(lmī)kas=tatō nimva(mba)-vṛikshas tasmād=apy=anantaraṁ pṛi-(pu)nas=tintṛi(ntri)ṇik=aiva ta-18 tō=nantaram=ēv=āṅkōla-mūla[m |*] Nai[r*]ṛityā[ṁ*] diśi sa[ṁ*]rōpita-pa(pā)śā (shā)ṇaḥ [|*] Paśchimasyā[ṁ](māyāṁ) di[śi*]19 vā(va)lmi(lmī)kaḥ(ka)s=tasmād=anantaraṁ timira-nimvō(mbaḥ) paśchima-dis-āsṛitā-vēya-vōyavya5 diśi u-20 bhaya-grāma-sa[ṁ*]milita-sīm-āśṛi(śri)tya(ta)-rāja-śāsan-ārōpita-śil=aiva | Uta(tta)rasyā[ṁ*] diśi vi-21 śa(sha)-vṛikshaḥ tasmā[d*]=dhananṁjaya[ḥ*] | vā(va)lmi(lmī)ka-halaṁdu-tintṛi(ntriṇi) kaḥ(kāḥ) [|*] ubhaya-grāma-mārgatas=taṭākaḥ(ka)-sahitau(ta)-bhūmiḥ [|*] Ga-(Gā)-22 ṅgēya-vaṅsa(vaṁśa)-pravarddhamāna-vihaya-rājyē samvatsara-śata-tini6 383 samvachchharē(saṁvatsarē) karaḥ7 [Phālguna-prati[padi*] ā-23 [kha(i?)-pāñcha-dēḍaḥ1 Mahāva-grāma-gōtrā(tra)-Nārāyaṇa-su(sū)nu-Nārāyaṇa-Jaḍyālā-kshē-trāya2 [|*] Pālanē dharma-sētuḥ [|*] Sarvadēvēna324 likhita[m*] |1 Considering the weight of other records of the later Imperial Gaṅga monarchs, it seems that the seven plates together with the seal weighed about one thousand tolas.2 Below his signature at the end of his transcript, we find the date given as the 16th of November, 1903.3 This is the Kendupatna copper-plate inscription (Saka 1218) of Gaṅga Narasimha II published by N.N. Vasu in 1893 in the Bengali Encyclopaedia entitled Viśvakōsha, Volume V, pp. 321 ff. See now above, Vol. XXVIII, pp, 191 ff.4 Pandit Gargavaṭu handed over the small book containing his transcript to Acharya in 1949. It reached Sircar in April 1950.1 See op. cit., p. 271.2 A similar sense of the word is also noticed in Telugu, Kannada and Tamil. It must have been borrowed in Oriya from Telugu.1 JRASB, Letters, Vol. XVII, pp. 19-26; JBRS, Vol. XXXVIII, part ii, pp. 225-29.2 The word is mahallāka, the same as mahallika or mahallaka meaning ‘a guard of the royal harem’. Visu-mahallāka was a goldsmith by caste. The word adhyaksa attached to the name of his grandson may suggest that the letter had some executive function in the market to which he belonged.1 From Pandit Ratnākara Gargavaṭu’s Oriya transcript.

Genealogical List given in Bhandarkar’s List and The Korni plates (JAHRS, Vol. I, p. 46)1 It is otherwise difficult to explain how even the reign-period of Vajrahasta III is given as 33 in one and 30 in another record of his grandson. Similarly the date of coronation of Vajrahasta II (960 Śaka) and that of Dēvēndravarman (992 Śaka) need not necessarily imply the beginning of their reigns, for we know that the coronation of Kāmārṇava took place in Śaka 1064 while his father was ruling till Śaka 1069.1 JBORS, Vol. XVIII, p. 272.2 JKHRS, Vol. I, p. 219.3 Loc. cit.1 From a set of impressions.2 Read sarvartao as in many other Gaṅga inscriptions.3 The mandasa plates and Simhipura grant (here in after abbreviated as M and S respectively) have prāsāda after this.4 Read ovirata-lalita-lāsyāt.5 This letter is redundant.6 M and S have du(dō)rdaṇḍa before paṇḍita.7 Read śaśāṅka-chūḍāmaṇēo.8 Read śabda.9 Read prabhā.10  S has vara-charana after this.11 Read nistriṁsa.12 Read dhār-ōpārjjitao.

The correct expression is of course pānīya-grāhin (cf. line 179)8 The names are written without vibhakti and are separated from one another by a single daṇḍa like a hyphen in English. The name of the gōtras is put at the beginning of the lists and is sometimes preceded and followed by a single or double daṇḍa. The expression used in some cases is gōtra but in others sagōtra. Some of the names exhibit considerable Prakrit and local influence.9 Ru was originally engraved.1 Cf. ḷ in the Oriya part of the Bhubaneswar bilingual inscription (JPASB, 1924, Plate I).2 These letters are engraved in the lower margin of the plate with indication that they are to be inserted in their proper place in the twentieth line on the face of the plate in question.3 These letters are incised in the lower margin of the plate with indication that they are to be inserted in their proper place in the eighth line on the face of the plate in question.1 There is an ornamental flower design between the double daṇḍas.2 Read dānāch=chhrēyōo.3 There is another ornamental flower design between the double daṇḍas here.

The reason for this may be the unsatisfactory formation of the aksharas.3 See. e.g., the Nadagam (above, Vol. IV, pp. 189 ff., and Plates) and Madras Museum (ibid., Vol. IX, pp. 96 ff., and Plates) plates of Vajrahasta III, father of Rājarāja I who issued the charter under study.

No. 4 of 1918-19) published in op.cit. pp.166 ff., 176 ff., and Plates, and the charters of his son Anantavarman Chöḍagaṅga such as the Korni plates of Śaka 1003 (ibid., Vol. I, pp. 40 ff., and Plates).4 See, e.g., the Kisarkella plates of Mahābhavagupta IV Uddyōtakēsarin (above, Vol. XXII, pp. 135 ff., and Plates).5 See, e.g., the Santiragrama grant of Daṇḍimahādēvī (above, Vol. XXIX, pp. 79 ff., and Plates).1 See, e.g., JBORS, Vol. XVIII, pp. 272 ff. and Plates; JAHRS, Vol. VIII, pp. 182 ff. and Plates.2 See JAHRS, Vol. I, pp. 44 ff; Vol. VIII, pp. 183 ff.; also above, Vol. XXVIII, pp. 239-40, 250, note 11.3 Above, Vol. XXX.

The introductory part of earlier Eastern Chālukya grants begins with the praśasti: śrīmatāṁ sakala-bhuvana-saṁstūyamāna, etc. (ibid, p. 33, text line 1) which reminds us of śrīmatām=akhita-bhuvana-vinuta, etc., of the charters of the Imperial Gaṅgas like the one under publication.1 Of the two other copper-plate grants found along with the present set, one belonging to Vajrahasta is edited below while the other issued by Māthara king Anantaśaktivarman has been published above, Vol. XXVIII pp. 177 ff. and Plate.

The Narasapatam plates have sa dēvaḥ || before this.2 Read śrīmad-Vajrao.3 The daṇḍa is superfluous4 There are traces of eight letters after this. [The entire passage from Vēsyāo to iti was incised after having erased what had been previously engraved. The name of the donee’s father in line 45-46 is written as Drādōrēva || na, although the subscript r in the first akshara and the ā-mātra in the second appear to be traces of the original engraving. The actual name may have been Dādē-Rēvana. In chērikāla (for chirakāla) in line 46, the i-mātrā of ri similarly belongs to the original writing. Traces of the eight aksharas after the end of the re-engraved record  in line 47 read tābhyāṁ Pōtaya-Kētayāo which is followed on the reverse of the plate (in line 48-49 of the original record, which were erased) by obhyāṁ udaka-purvvāṁ (pūrvvāṁ) tāmra-śāsanaṁ kriivā pradattam= asmābhir=bhāvibhir-bhūmipālai…. This shows that the grant of the village of Santaram (possibly not Santarama) had originally been made in favour of Kētaya and Pōtaya but that later it was transferred to Pallaya and the sentence mentioning him as the donee was reengraved after having erased the original writing. The word tābhyāṁ at the beginning of this sentence shows that the previous sentence, on which Vēsyā….iti was later incised, contained a description of Pōtaya and Kētaya, the original donees of the charter. Pallaya pleased the king by his valour (paurusha) and the latter gave him the village after having honoured him for a considerable time (chirakālam=ārāddhya).

It is given as Hōmaṇḍi in an endorsement on the outer side of Plate III of the grant. Cf. JAS, Letters, Vol. XVIII, p. 78, note.—Ed.]4 [The correct reading of the name seems to be Kāmaḍi. Apparently the same name is given as Kōmaṇḍi in the endorsement, according to which he received the hamlet of Vapavaḍā (spelt Vapavāṭa in the main charter) attached to Hōmaṇḍi from Rāṇaka Udayakhēḍika who was the son and successor of Ugrakhēḍi of the main charter according to the Nirakarpur plates.—Ed.]5 JBRS, Vol. XXXV, pp. 1 ff.6 It may be mentioned in this connection that one Dharmakhēḍī and his father Bhīmakhēḍī are mentioned in the Santa-Bommali plates (JAHRS, Vol. III, pp. 171 ff.) of the Gaṅga year 520 and the Mandasa plates (A.R.Ep., 1918, pp. 138 ff.; JBORS, Vol. XVII, p. 184) of the Śaka year 976. A Kadamba chieftain of the name of Dharmakhēḍī is also mentioned in the Vizagapatam plates (Ind. Ant., Vol. XVIII, pp. 144 ff.) of Dēvēndravarman, dated in the Gaṅga year 254. The Kambakaya plates (A.R.Ep., 1927-28, App. No. 9; Journ. Bomb. Hist. Soc., Vol. IV, pp. 27-28; JAHRS, Vol. X, pp. 916 ff.) of Śaka 1103 also refer to the Kadamba chief named Dharmakhēḍī and Udayāditya. From the widely separated dates of these inscriptions, it is reasonable to hold that, though some of these Kadamba chieftains bear the same names, they are not to be considered as identical because of the identity of their names alone but should be placed in different periods. [There is difference of opinion among scholars about the dates of the Mandasa and Kambakaya plates.—Ed.]1 Ind. Ant., Vol. XIII, p. 276.2 JBRS, Vol. XXV, pp. 10 ff.3 [See below, p. 322, note 2.—Ed.]4 From inked impressions.5 Denoted by symbol. Rajaguru does not read this symbol. The minor errors in his transcript of the inscription have not been noted in every case.6 Read yaśāḥ.1 Read ovarmmā tasya.2 Sandhi has not been observed here.3 [The sentence remains incomplete. The mention of the donee and the gift land, found in line 21-23 below, should have been made here.—Ed.]4 [Better read oākulita-śrita-garttātataḥ.—Ed.]5 Read odiś-āśrita-Vāyavyāṁ. [Or,ośrita ēva | Vāyavyāṁ.—Ed.]6 Read saṁvatsara-śata-trayē  try-aśīty-uttarē.7 Its meaning is not clear to me. [The reading intended is apparently sāṁvatsarika-karaḥ meaning ‘annual rent’ (cf. above, Vol. XXX, p. 115.).—Ed.]1 I am not sure of the import of this passage. [The language of the passage is defective. But it seems to quote the amount of annual rent to be paid in the month of Phālguna every year. The word dēḍa reminds us of dēḍha-śata-rupya 150 in other kara-śāsana of this kind (cf. JRAS, 1952, p.5).—Ed.]2 [The language of the passage is defective. But it seems to mean that the donee’s name was Nārāyaṇa and that he received a piece of land (or its revenue income) in the village of Jaḍyālā. Lines 13 and 20-21 seem to suggest that the gift land lay along a road between the village of Jaḍyālā and Vōṅkhara and that there was a pond in it. The name of the donee’s father was Gōtranārāyaṇa and he was a resident of Mahāva-grāma.—Ed.]3 There is a mark afther this letter.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
